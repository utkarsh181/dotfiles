#+TITLE: .dotfiles

* Introduction

This repository contains my Emacs and other configurations for GNU/Linux.
It is managed with the help of GNU Stow.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/utkarsh181/dotfiles
  $ cd dotfiles
  $ stow -t "$HOME" -v emacs
#+END_SRC

The above will clone my dotfiles in =dotfiles=.  Then stow will produce
a symlink of my Emacs files to your home directory.

Other common =stow= operations are:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Re-install stow "package"
  $ stow -t "$HOME" -R emacs

  # Delete stow package
  $ stow -t "$HOME" -D emacs
#+END_SRC

* Setup
  
I maintain [[https://github.com/utkarsh181/AEBS][AEBS]] which is used to deploy my dotfiles on Arch based
distributions.
