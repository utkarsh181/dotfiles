;;; Commentary:

;; Adds support for pdf-view (from `pdf-tools') buffers in
;; `save-place-mode'.
;;
;; If using pdf-view-mode, this package will automatically persist
;; between Emacs sessions the current PDF page, size and other
;; information returned by `pdf-view-bookmark-make-record' using
;; `save-place-mode'.  Visiting the same PDF file will restore the
;; previously displayed page and size.
