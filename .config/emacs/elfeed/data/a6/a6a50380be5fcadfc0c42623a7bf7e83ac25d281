<p>When you have a single-user system, or one with only one user with sudoer access, I always used to hate that every time I became root, I'd lose the settings set in my bashrc and aliases, my vimrc and preferred directory shortcuts.
About 6 months ago, I had the crazy idea to change the root user's home directory from <code>/root</code> to <code>/home/luke</code> so root would look in my main directory for all its dotfiles.</p>

<p>I was initially worried that this could cause some vulnerabilities, it might still, but I have to say that it's been <b>hugely</b> convenient and hasn't given me any problems in all these months, so I recommend trying it out. All you have to do is open <code>/etc/passwd</code> and change the directory on the line starting with <code>root:</code> to your typical home directory.</p>

<p>So whenever you log in as root, you'll still have access to all your rc settings, and will be in your familiar home folder.
I didn't think of it before, but you'll also have fewer log files to have to sort through.
For example, if I once worked out a compilcated shell command and am trying to look it up in my <code>.bash_history</code>, I used to have to check <code>/home/luke/.bash_history</code> <em>and</em> <code>/root/.bash_history</code> if I couldn't remember if I ran it as myself or root.
Now, however, both accounts use the same history file for bash, and also other programs.</p>

<p>So anyway, I recommend trying it out. I'm sure I'll get a couple emails about how it could be potentially dangerous, but the convenience has been huge and I've had no problems, although I might not recommend doing this on your webserver to hedge against unknown vulnerabilities.</p>
