<p>That's only slightly a hyperbole.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about bringing back the podcast; it's probably the only old content I get <em>constant</em> requests to bring back. I'm already compiling stuff for a few new episodes for Season 2, which might actually include some joint episodes with people you may or may not know... We'll see!</p>

<p>Anyway, I finally finished and put up an episode I did in a stream months ago:
<a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S01E08_-_The_Flaws_of_Academic_Statistics_the_Null_Ritual.mp3">The Flaws of Academic Statistics: the Null Ritual</a> which you can see
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an0RFLzJ5Yo&list=PL-p5XmQHB_JQTeUxtGBI7sHCOOuY4qT-B&index=2&t=0s">on YouTube</a> as well.
This episode is talks about some of the fundamental and acknowledged issues in how statistics is used in nearly all sciences.
Nearly every science paper you've heard of in the popular press and in academia is built on flawed statistical footing.
