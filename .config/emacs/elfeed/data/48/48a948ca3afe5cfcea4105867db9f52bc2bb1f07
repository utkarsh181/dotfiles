<p>A couple days ago, I put up <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb">this repository (https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vul)</a> which is a command-line interface to the Greek Bible (the Septuagint and SBL New Testament).</p>

<p>Since I had gone ahead and done that, I decided I'd make and put up two other related repositories:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A fork of the original King James Version Bible interface that the repo above is based on. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/kjv">Get it here.</a> My repo, compared to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bontibon/kjv">the original it's forked from</a> is the same, but with the Apocrypha also included.</li>
	<li>A similar program, but for the Latin Vulage Bible. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vul">Get it here.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll put up a video on these in a while so my non-blog/RSS viewers will know about them.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
