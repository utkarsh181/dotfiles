<p>A lot of people said that they'd like to fund the channel/me, but are (understandably) nervous about Patreon and Paypal. I've now added a <a href="https://liberapay.com/LukeSmith">LiberaPay account</a>, which is a much freer and privacy respecting platform, which also doesn't take a slice off the top fo every transfer.</p>

<p>If you don't trust Patreon or Paypal (which you shouldn't really), throw your support in via LiberaPay. It'd honestly be better generally to get channel funding there anyway!</p>
