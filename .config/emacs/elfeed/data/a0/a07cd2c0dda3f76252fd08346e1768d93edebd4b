<ul>
	<li>Soydev level: Will be able to see some behind the scenes vids and if I bring back the forum, you'll be invited</li>
	<li>Zoomer level: Same as above, but also get access to my Mumble server and be able to chat with me and others there.</li>
	<li>Boomer level: Mumble access and the "Dispatches from the Unaboomer's Cabin" series, on my on-going process of going /innawoods/ (series starts April 15th)</li>
	<li>Chad leve: Mumble access, "Dispatches" series, and the ability to come onto livestreams and direct discussion</li>
</ul>
