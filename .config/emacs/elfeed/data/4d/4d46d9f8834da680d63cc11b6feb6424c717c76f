<p>First off, I put up a brief video talking about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fv7hN5q1N0">why I don't like using cell phones</a>, it seems it's already gotten some good feedback, so check it out if you haven't already. Cell phones are devices that encourage a kind of superficiality of mind and habit, and are not nearly as useful as we think they are. Having a truly free-as=in-freedom and privacy-respecting cell phone is, by large part, impossible.</p>

<p>There's also been a lot of great feedback on the first episode of <a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/notrelated">,Not Related</a>, which I'll go over in the next episode. I've got my prep mostly ready, I don't want to divulge the exact topic, yet. I think I'll let each episode be a surprise. I've also bought <a target="_blank" href="http://notrelated.xyz">NotRelated.xyz</a>, but as of now it will just direct to my own homepage.</p>

<p>By the way, since the first podcast, there was a book I mentioned in passing, Eric Cline's <em>1177 B.C.: The year Civilization Collapsed</em>. It popped in my head while recording, so I mentioned it, because I had heard very good things about it, but I decided it'd be a little hypocritical to even name-drop it without reading it ;-), so in the time since the episode, I got and read through in full and a half.</p>

<p>I'll say it's definitely good and worth reading. A little repetitive, but in a way that facilitates retention. If you're interesting in the period or want to get a wider view of it after the <a target="_blank" href="http://notrelated.libsyn.com/website/the-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind">Bicameral Mind</a> episode, it might be a good starting point for a historical view. There's an audiobook of it floating out there too.</p>
