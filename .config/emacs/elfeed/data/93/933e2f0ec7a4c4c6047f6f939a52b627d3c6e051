<p>I've actually had a Gitlab since Github was bought by Microsoft, but I had never bothered using it and simply had it mirror my main repos.
Since a lot of people actually do use it now, and some exclusively, I will actually be pushing all of my changes that I push to Github to Gitlab as well.
I'll also be watching Gitlab for Issues and PRs, for those of you who use Gitlab and Gitlab only, so feel free to abstain from using Github entirely to communicate with me and my repos.

<p>Subscribe to the RSS feed of my Gitlab events here: <code><a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/LukeSmithxyz.atom">https://gitlab.com/LukeSmithxyz.atom</a></code> Or follow me?? I don't actually know if there's following on Gitlab. Sorry, Boomer here when it comes to technology. You might know that I never follow/subscribe to anyone on any site as a rule myself so I never keep track...</p>
