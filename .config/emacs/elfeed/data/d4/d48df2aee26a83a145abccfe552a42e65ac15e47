<p>I put up a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Q7reJtiLU">why I don't use or trust Wikipedia anymore</a>.
It's gotten so bad over the years that I don't even trust it for little things.
I might do more on this later, because I think it's a weather-vane kind of issue, but that's my take on it now.</p>

<p>Obviously I don't trust it for news or politics, but I also can't trust it for specialized topics I'm familiar with: it doesn't very accurately represent academic issues in linguistics, philosophy or especially the history of thought.
This has totally undermined my view of the enterprise in total and I'll be relying on a constellation of smaller sites when I need "basic" encyclopedia information.</p>

<p>Also, for a thumbnail, I'm looking for any meme containing a depiction of Richard Stallman as either a crying wojak or a pink wojak.
I'm sure someone has this and I'm very busy today and can't look too much more after a cursory search... I'll be leaving the house soon...</p>
