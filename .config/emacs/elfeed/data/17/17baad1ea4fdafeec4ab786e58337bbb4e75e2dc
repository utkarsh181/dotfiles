<p>I've added <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/wishlist.html#sortmatchfirst">a new entry to the Hacking Wishlist</a>.
This one I was racking my brain a little on last night, but couldn't find an elegant solution. It's probably obvious though.
</p>

<p>
I want a sed/awk command (probably awk, actually) that can take a stream and a regular expression and move all the lines before that regular expression to the end of the file.
Sounds simple, but for whatever reason, I haven't developed a solution!
I need to brush up my awk skills!
