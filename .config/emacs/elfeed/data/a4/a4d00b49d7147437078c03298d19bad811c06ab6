<p>Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKviflL9XeI">this new video</a> where I talk about tiling window management for newbs, but I also talk about some of the additions to my dotfiles I've added in the past year and a half since I did <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BOW61luzF4">my last video on i3</a>.</p>

<p>Additions include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Several dmenu interfaces for USB mounting, display selection, emoji insertion and more</li>
	<li>More documentation for other users, including clickable statusbar info and a more complete Super+F1 guide</li>
	<li>Better backends for dropdown terminals</li>
</ul>

<p>And more...</p>
