<p>I've been at Southeast Linuxfest the past two days. I'll probably do a full review later, but here are some highlights so far.</p>

<ul>
<li>My subscribers are not nearly as weird as I anticipated, and seem to be actually less weird than the average Linux user.</li>
<li>There actually were some girls Linuxfest (although no obvious <font color="green">&gt;girls</font>).</li>
<li>My talk was pretty crowded; standing room only. It also generated a lot of good discussion. I polled the audience and about half of them knew me (usually the younger ones).</li>
<li>Some boomer guy began to unironically "Interject" to my use of the term "Linux" as I used it in the talk ;-)</li>
<li>I even had a very young fan (as in utterly prepubescent fan) besting even Pewdiepie's fans in youth. He asked for an autograph and picture.</li>
<li>Linuxfest was generally well-organized but there were some huge oversights. The rooms were only equipped to handle HDMI inputs. This basically ruined Michael Tunnell's presentation which was right before mine (and probably others) since they couldn't record from his laptop. Poor guy had to use some useless Chromebook (which its distinct lack of keys) to try to preview kdenlive. They couldn't record from mine either, but I'm not going to let that happen, so I just went Harambe Mindframe and connected to the screen VGA input, bypassing their recording rig and recorded the talk on my own machine. This is something that the speakers should not have to be worrying about.</li>
<li>People got a little peeved by the organizer's keynote, because it went way, way over on time, and then was followed by another talk that ruffled some vocal SJW feathers (basically a critique of witch-hunting codes of conduct). This is just what I gleamed from people, all of whom were really tired after a long day, because I sat these talks out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, it's been nice meeting all of you who have/had come! Again, I might do a video update after the whole thing is over.</p>
