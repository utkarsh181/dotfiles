<p>I've actually decided to change my website's index page, <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">check it out</a>.
I made it a bit more autobiographical and visual. Maybe I missed something important? Feel free to remind me.
</p>

<p>
There are images on the mainpage now, which means a little more bandwith used, but it's nowhere close to the odious things that soydevs do with massive 8MB background images.
Even a really slow internet like mine should be able to load it all in a fraction of a second.
</p>

<p>I want to move step-by-step back to the old simple days of the early internet, where personal webpages were actual webpages, not two lines of links to social media profiles over off-white bacgrounds and massive javascript to make sure the site load sufficiently slowly. Sooner or later, I'm going to make a LARBS-like thing for setting up a VPS with a good weserver. Already did it for an <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/emailwiz">email server</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't wanted to upload videos recently. I don't fake it.
I will want to overview in a video all of the chages and features I've integrrated into dwm, but I'm not totally sure that I'm all the way done.
Most of the binds on the middle and lower rows under the left hand I'm just not sure about!</p>

<p>By the way, yesterday or so I add an optional <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/statusbar/nettraf">network traffic module</a> to my statusbar scripts.
I think I wrote it about as efficiently as it could be written (and no dependencies), but I was knew to figuring out how RX/TX info appears in a Unix system.
Check it out and see if it can be improved.
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm thinking about, since I can make it clickable, adding some kind of network monitoring TUI program, ideally one that either gives visual information about network traffic over time, <em>or</em> (maybe better if it's done well) an application that lists connections made to different sites/IP addresses.
If anyone has any recommendations, let me know,
</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh and by the way, if my website looks funky right now, refresh your browser's cache (specifically of the stylesheet (style.css) on my site).</p>
