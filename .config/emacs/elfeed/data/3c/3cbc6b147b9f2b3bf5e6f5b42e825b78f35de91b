<p>At the top of the next hour, I'll be releasing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XtNXutVto">a full-length video commentary and instructional on vim</a>.
I decided to record this yesterday somewhat flippantly: I got through the entirety of vimtutor adding extra information and tips along with commentary.
The whole thing ended up being one cut and slighty longer than an hour!
I'm releasing it as a premiere.</p>

<p>Note also I did a video yesterday talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5UEuWMlqRI">the ever-expanding ways</a> you can be monitored with cell phones and software.</p>
