<p>I just put up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npht_ISGL0g">a video on this</a>, but I'll put it in text for anyone who prefers it.</p>

<p>After a lot of requests, I'm going to start doing livestreams again.
Problem is, until next January, I won't have consistent internet at my home to make that possible.
So we can manage a little workaround:
</p>

<p>
I'm now, right now, taking "Super Chats" or donations from <a target="_blank" href="https://paypal.me/lukemsmith">PayPal</a> or <a target="_blank" href="crypto.html">different crypto currencies</a>.
I'll record full responses to questions in the same way I would do a livestream.
I'll probably also come with other content prepared.
</p>

<p>
Then, that full video, the length and style of a livestream will be uploaded to YouTube using the new "Premiere" feature, which allows a set release time and a chatroom just like in livestreams.
Everyone can watch it together then, talking in the chat.
Obviously I'll be in the chatroom as it plays for everyone simultaneously.
</p>

<p>I'm planning to release this video <b>Sunday afternoon</b>.</p>

<p>That means if you want to donate to ask a question or pose a comment or point of discussion, donate (using the links about) ASAP.
I'm not entirely sure when I'm going to be recording the video, but I suspect sometime Saturday.
If you miss that window though, I'll read your donation and talk about what you want next time, so no problem.
</p>
