<p>Most people do. Luckily, for all the complaining, there is a simple replacement for it that cuts out the middle man altogether and transfers money directly and immediately between bank accounts.</p>

<p>You probably haven't heard of it, but there is a new money transfer system that most banks in the United States maintain called <b>Zelle</b>.
It's really just a protocol for transferring money directly from account to account with just an email, so it works pretty much with the ease of PayPal.
It is actually a service offered for free (no fees at all) by most American banks.
</p>

<p><b>If you have any bank account in the United States, you probably already have Zelle and don't know it.</b></p>

<p>So for all those who want to donate to the channel but don't want to be bothered to use Paypal/Patreon, here's how to use it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Log on to your online banking for whatever bank you have.</li>
	<li>Search for a "transfer money" or "Zelle" section.</li>
	<li>(You may have to confirm your email, but "setup" is automatic.)</li>
	<li>When asked for a recipient, just put in my email address: <big>luke@lukesmith.xyz</big></li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits of Zelle:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It's managed by banks as a free tool for their customers, so it doesn't skim some money off the top of your donation.</li>
	<li>You don't need to sign up and create an account on some new website.</li>
	<li>You can send a single lump-sum donation if you hate PayPal, or set up recurring donations if you hate Patreon.</li>
	<li>Zelle, being owned by banks regulated up the wazoo is less likely to ZUCC you. I've never heard of anyone being ZUCCed by them in fact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, you can donate <em>directly</em> to me, no charge using Zelle and my email:</p>

<p><big>luke@lukesmith.xyz</big></p>

<p>I'll be adding these directions <a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/zelle.html">here</a> for reference.</p>

<p>I might actually do a video on this, just so more people know.</p>
