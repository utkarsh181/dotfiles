<p>I was thinking of adding to the <a href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS website</a> some screenshots, but I thought it would be really lame if I just pulled up some htop windows and took some screenshots myself.</p>

<p>For those of you who use LARBS, if you have changed it a little or a lot, if you see yourself doing something "interesting" looking that could look like a good advertisement, just hit PrintScreen and <a href="mailto:luke@lukesmith.xyz">send it to me</a>.</p>

<p>Anonymize/blur whatever you want private on your own.</p>

<p>If I post a small gallery of these on a page on the LARBS website, give me a screen name or real name if you want it to be identified with you (being anonymous is, of course fine).</p>
