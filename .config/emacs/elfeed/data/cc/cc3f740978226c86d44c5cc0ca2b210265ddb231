<p>I've thankfully developed a tendency to make side remarks about things in videos that I'm not sure or don't know about because often times people will fill me in on them.</p>

<p>Yesterday I complained about having to use a cell phone to do Two Factor Authentication (2FA) and asked for another way.
As it ends up, using a cell phone for 2FA is apparently just a bad, normie-friendly way to do it.
And we aren't normie friendly, anyway are we?</p>

<p>Many informed me that SMS protocol (i.e. texting) is actually a highly insecure way to do Two Factor Authentication.
I did also know that there are authenticator apps, but these are often talked about as if they are always cell phone applications.
Very not true.</p>

<p>In fact, <code>pass</code>, the password manager that I use (and I also require it for <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/mutt-wizard">mutt-wizard</a>) has an installable module <code>pass-otp</code> in most repositories that does just this without the need for a celular monitoring device and service, etc.</p>

<p>Install it, and let's say I want it to manage my <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1">coinbase</a> 2FA.
Well, go to Coinbase's website and click the option to add/change an authenticator app.
They'll give you a QR which you can download (I'll assume it's called 'download.png' here).
Then, use <code>zbar</code> (which you may need to install) to read the QR code image and pipe it into this <code>pass</code> command.
</p>

<pre><code>zbarimg -q --raw download.png | pass otp insert coinbase</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever you run <code>pass otp coinbase</code>, you will get a 6-digit 2FA code.
After a few seconds, of course, it will change to another 6-digit code like other 2FA applications.</p>

<p>So this is pretty dope.
You could also start using this for scripting/API access if you know what you're doing.
One more thing I don't have to use my cell phone for.
I feel like a boomer for not knowing this before...
</p>

<p>Now the other thing I'd really want is the ability to access SMS protocol on a computer to receive text messages without (a) a cell phone and (b) cell phone service at my location.
The big issue for me is that I have no mobile service in my house (I have to walk out to the north side of my property to get texts). I don't have wifi-calling either.
Some people have submitted some suggestions and I'm still going through them, but we'll see.
I just wish normies could send me a message at a number they <em>think</em> is a normal cell phone, but I can receive on my computer without a cell signal.</p>
