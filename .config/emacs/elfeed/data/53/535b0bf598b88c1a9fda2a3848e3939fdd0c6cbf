<p>I've just uploaded the newest episode of <em>Not Related!</em> which you can get <a href="https://notrelated.libsyn.com/when-youre-too-rational-to-be-rational">here</a>!</p>

<p>
The topic is the reality of what is actually "logical" in the brain and in human action.
In your intro psychology classes, you'll likely be inundated with stories of the cognitive glitches that humans suffer from, most of which stemming from the prying research of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the so-called <em>Heuristics and Biases</em> program.

But in this episode we briefly review this perspective, but also the rejoinder to it in the school of thought typically termed <em>Ecological Rationality</em>, specifically as described in Gerd Gigerenzer's <em>Rationality for Mortals: How People Cope with Uncertainty</em>.
From this perspective, many very human tendencies which will appear "irrational" in terms of formal logic are very reasonable in real life, and humans are equiped with an Adaptive Toolbox of mental heuristics to deal with complex problems.
