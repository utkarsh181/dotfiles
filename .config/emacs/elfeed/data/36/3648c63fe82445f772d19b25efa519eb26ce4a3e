<p>I actually somewhat enjoyed doing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8XtNXutVto">"Vim Diesel"</a> hour long vim tutorial...</p>

<p>So I decided to do something I've been asked about over the years, and that is to do a series on very basic command-line/terminal/shell/bash usage.</p>

<p>I've put up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4gE8k2RE_s">the first video in this series here</a> so check it out. Although it's very basic, covering the key commands and key-bindings on the terminal, you might learn something or another new or forgotten...</p>
