<p>I have some real-world work to do this week, I have to finish writing a website and have to do some data analysis for a study, probably in R. If that ends up being interesting, I might actually just post a stream of it.</p>
		<p>Otherwise, this week I'll probably put up a Battlestation video, and possibly the first of a linguistics-themed podcast.</p>
