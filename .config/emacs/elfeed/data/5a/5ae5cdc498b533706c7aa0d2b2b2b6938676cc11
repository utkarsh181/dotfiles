<p>I've been taking a week off from some things, including <a href="http://notrelated.xyz">Not Related!</a> to do some reading and research and maybe even bulk up. I'll have a new episode of the podcast (mostly planned out) out next week and I think I'll do a screencast over the weekend.</p>

<p>
You may've noticed I haven't done a livestream in a while, but I'm thinking to start again.
I'm not entirely sure how my internet up connection is here, but I might be doing a stream next Tuesday or Wednesday around midday around Amerimutt time.
