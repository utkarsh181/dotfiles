<p>I've been cleaning out a whole lot of old crud on my computer, and some of this is making its way into my dotfiles.
To make sure you know what I'm moving around, I'll put a notice here. Especially if you fetch or pull the new changes, be away of what's below so you don't get confused.</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>~/.scripts/shortcuts.sh</code> has now lost the <code>.sh</code> to keep with the style of the other scripts. It also no longer downloads template files if not present (this was a holdover of when it was part of its own repo).</li>
	<li>Similarly, the <code>~/.scripts/folders</code> and <code>~/.scripts/configs</code> files that the script used have moved to the home directory, to <code>~/.key_directories</code> and <code>~/.key_files</code>. The name change of the later reflects that I now use this file and the shortcut script to just to text documents I'm working on, not just config files. In the short future, I'll have other scripts reading these files as well. I haven't really added any lines to the public copies though, as I still expect them to be very user-dependent.</li>
	<li>The <code>dmenuunicode</code> script I showcased in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCEXY46t3OA">a recent video</a> has undergone a small addition that will also copy the unicode character's code value to primary selection while the character itself is copied to the clipboard. There are times when this can be very useful when it's necessary to get code. The input file for this script has also been moved to <code>~/.emojis</code> and now was many more emojis, including flags ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.</li>
	<li><b>Importantly, I am also cleaning out now unused configs files that I do not maintain.</b> Since this is a git repo, obiovusly nothing is lost to time, but the dotfiles for polybar, qutebrowser, rofi and other programs I don't use anymore won't be there by default on LARBS unless I hear an outcrying to the contrary. I know I got many people using polybar and qutebrowser, but qb's settings are constantly changing, so I can't be expected to keep up and polybar has always been riddled with compilation problems. (Since users need to compile it anyway, it's been a thorn in my side for LARBS as well in the past.)</li>
</ul>
