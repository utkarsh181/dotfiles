I've just put up a brief video on <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/2WTljV8_9S8">making your own QR codes</a>.
I guess everyone has <em>seen</em> QR codes, but not everyone has used them, but they're quite useful! I give a brief explanation in the vid.

For some reason, a lot of people use services on other people's computers to do this when you really just have to install <code>qrencode</code>, which is a pretty simple program to use.
I illustrate it in the video for those of you too intelligent to just run <code>qrencode -h</code>.
