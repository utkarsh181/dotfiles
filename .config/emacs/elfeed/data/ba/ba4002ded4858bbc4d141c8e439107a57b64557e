<p>Last month, my colleague Ryan and I put out a brief introductory podcast episode, planning a series on academic affairs. We never planned out how frequent these would come out, and due to a series of life effects, it might look like it was a one time thing.</p>
		<p>The feedback we got though was overwhelming and encouraging, especially given how little most of my subscribers probably cared about the issues before hand. I also had a lot of grad students in the field email glowingly. Even better was the "negative" attention we got, mostly from the Old Guard and the typical pearl-clutchers in our department. The very gall of us to serve as faces to the universal discontentment.</p>
		<p>Ryan was witness to a particularly embarrassing encounter with a certaie professor absolutely apoplectic about the podcast, and recounted it to me with much gusto, variegated with uncontrollable laughter.</p>
		<p>Needless to say, the more episodes are in the tubes. We're enjoying where this is going already.</p>
