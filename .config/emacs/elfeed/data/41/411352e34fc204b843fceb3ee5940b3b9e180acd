<p>I'm in the process of moving into a place with much better internet, and as such, I'll be able to do livestreams! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqCdd3z6R0U">As I say briefly in this video</a>, I'll be having an end-of-year livestream which will have the functionality of a typical livestream, but with some prep in the <code>/var</code> as well: a review of all the content and happenings on the channel in the last year along with topical meme videos.</p>

<p>I'll announce the exact time(zone) later on this feed. You can also feel free to send in suggestion videos as well.</p>
