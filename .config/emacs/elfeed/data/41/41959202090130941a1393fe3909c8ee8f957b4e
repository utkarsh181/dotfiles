<p>In this video I demonstrate the numerous custom functions I have defined
for interfacing with Bongo, the media manager for Emacs.  My extensions
are designed to facilitate my workflow: managing and playing back a
large local music collection, with the help of Dired and other Emacs
facilities.</p>

<p>The following block presents the contents of the code I used in this
video.  Please note that <em>the code block will not be updated</em>.  For the
latest version of everything I share on this front, you should refer
directly to <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">my dotemacs</a> (the link
points to the web page, but there is also a git source linked from
there).</p>

These files are meant to reference filesystem paths.  They ease
the task of playing media from closely related directory trees,
without having to interfere with the user's directory
structure (e.g. a playlist file 'rock' can include the paths of
~/Music/Scorpions and ~/Music/Queen).

This works by appending the absolute filesystem path of each item
to the selected playlist file.  If no marks are available, the
item at point will be used instead.

Selecting a non-existent file at the prompt will create a new
entry whose name matches user input.  Depending on the completion
framework, such as with `icomplete-mode', this may require a
forced exit (e.g. \\[exit-minibuffer] to parse the input without
further questions).
