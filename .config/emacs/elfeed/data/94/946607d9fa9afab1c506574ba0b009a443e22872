</p>

<p>
One of the weird things that has happened since I <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0_UOc">put out my video on installing Arch Linux</a> and since I release <a target="_blank" href="https://larbs.xyz">LARBS</a> is that I get a lot of people who install Arch and LARBS without knowing anything about it!
I suppose that's a good thing, but I've begun to get very basic questions from people who don't know the absolute basics of pacman.

<p>The video above is a response to this.
It covers installing, updating, searching for, listing and manpulating packages and other pacman settings, some of which maybe even veteran users might not be familiar with.
