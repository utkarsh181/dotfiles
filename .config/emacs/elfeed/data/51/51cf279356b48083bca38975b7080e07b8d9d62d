 <h2 id="orgafcdee5">Introduction</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgafcdee5">
 <p>
Allow me to introduce  <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages">Helm System Packages</a>, an interface to your system package
manager.  (Check out the screencasts on the home page.)
</p>

 <p>
Highlights:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>List, search, filter and select packages incrementally.</li>

 <li>All actions work on multiple packages.</li>

 <li>Display information of multiple packages in an Org buffer.</li>

 <li>(Un)Install a selection of packages.</li>

 <li>Browse the (reverse) dependency graph with the same Helm interface.</li>

 <li>Find files with Helm (again, over multiple packages).</li>

 <li>Each package manager interface comes with its set of specializations.  For
instance it has a source for USE flags when Portage is detected.</li>

 <li>Last but not least, Helm sessions can be resumed, which means actions can be
chained over the same package selection.</li>
</ul> <p>
It’s been packaged for Guix and MELPA.

 <h2 id="org3e30fc1">Motivation</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3e30fc1">
 <p>
I believe that most package manager’s graphical interfaces take the approach of
providing a “user-friendly” experience with a familiar toolkit (GTK, Qt, you
name it), while leaving aside usability enhancements that could make them
worth the use to everyone.
</p>

 <p>
As a results, many power users solely resort to a commandline usage.  It’s a
shame, really, because of the many intrinsic limitations of shells (especially
if  <a href="../emacs-eshell/index.html">you don’t use Eshell</a>), namely the cumbersome search-fix-process steps:
</p>

 <ol class="org-ol"> <li>Search for local packages.</li>
 <li>Package missing?  Search for remote packages.</li>
 <li>List is too long?  Pipe through a pager.</li>
 <li>(Un)install the desired package by writing the searched package names again.</li>
</ol> <p>
With Helm, all those actions get factored into one.
Based on Emacs, it also naturally comes with a bunch of perks:
</p>

 <ul class="org-ul"> <li>Keyboard driven.</li>
 <li>Self-documented.</li>
 <li>Customizable.</li>
 <li>As portable as Emacs is.</li>
 <li>Works in a TTY too!</li>
</ul></div>

 <p>
The original work was done by Helm’s current maintainer Thierry Volpiatto on
 <a href="https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto/helm-gentoo">Portage</a> and dpkg.  I’ve compiled his work together and added support for  <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/">pacman</a>.
 <i>Helm System Packages</i> now effectively acts as a uniform abstraction for
managing packages across different systems.
</p>

 <p>
I’ve later added support for Void Linux’  <a href="https://voidlinux.org/usage/xbps/">xbps</a> and  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/">Guix</a>.  Not all package
managers are equally well supported because I can’t possibly be using all of
them, so contributions are welcome to bring them all up to speed!
</p>

 <p>
Performance should be good. If not, please report.  Also please report if you
notice some packages or categories are missing.
</p>

 <p>
Contributions (and issue reports) are welcome!

 <h2 id="orgab3073e">UX-experiment: a (somewhat) user-friendly, stand-alone version</h2>
 <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgab3073e">
 <p>
For many years I’ve been looking for a straightforward interface to the  <i>pacman</i>
package manager for the less techie of us.  Now that I’ve worked on  <i>Helm System
Packages</i> for Emacs users, I thought it would be nice to try it out on non-Emacs
users.
</p>

 <p>
As an experiment, I’ve written a small program that automates the installation
and the configuration of  <i>Helm System Packages</i> in a separate directory.  (It
won’t interfere with your Emacs files.)  You can  <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-system-packages/blob/master/stand-alone/helm-system-packages">try it out</a>, it’s a simple
portable script that only requires Emacs ≥ 24.4 and a supported package manager.
</p>

 <p>
Feedback is more than welcome on that side! :)
