<p>A couple years ago, I bought <a target="_blank" href="http://currentyear.net">currentyear.net</a> with the idea of turning it into a meme news site for fun.
I obviously didn't end up doing it, so I'm thinking about parting with the domain name to anyone who thinks they might be able to put it to good use!</p>

<p>
If anyone wants it, name a price and I'll sell it to you relatively cheap as far as domains go.
If there are no takers within a couple of days, I'll probably put it on sale publicly with Namecheap for a good bit more than I'd settle for now.
