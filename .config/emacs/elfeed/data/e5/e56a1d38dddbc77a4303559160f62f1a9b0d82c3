<p>In addition to the changes I mentioned yesterday to LARBS,
I've also just pushed some changes to the repository that sort all of the scripts into new directories for organizational purpose: a subdirectory for statusbar scripts (<code>statusbar/</code>), one for crons (<code>cron/</code>), etc.
All of these directories are now added automatically to the path with this line in <code>~/.profile</code>:
</p>

<p><code>
export PATH="$(du $HOME/.scripts/ | cut -f2 | tr '
' ':')$PATH"
</code></p>

<p>
These changes shouldn't cause any problem so long as this line is added, but be sure to tell me if you get these changes and something breaks for you. I've been running it with these changes and have been without any hiccups.
</p>
