I believe I mentioned in the most recent livestream that I'd be refinishing the top of my enormous workdesk, which has sustained substantial damage over the years.
I've now put <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0a7GegepvI">the video of me doing just that up</a>.
You can look at it as a kind of tutorial, but I was sort of learning as I went myself.

The whole process of refinishing, even my amateurish job, made the old desk look like new and I recommend you try it on your own degraded wooden furniture.
It's a quite easy process.
It really amounts to sanding the thing down with increasing grits of sandpaper, then spraying several coats of lacquer staggered by drying times.
The end result is quite impressive given how disgusting the original was.
