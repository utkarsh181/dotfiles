<p>I've been redesigning the website again, trying to simplify it.
Before, I was going for a "personal introduction" with pictures on the mainpage, but now I'm going for something slimmer.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is always <em>fitting all the links I have so that they aren't annoying!</em>
While I lack most social media sites, it's a pain having so many video archives and other things to link...
I've decided to go with a classic dropdown menu (pure CSS, sorry JS-soydevs).</p>

<p>I do want to start writing up more guides and content on my website proper, and that might happen soon.
We'll see.</p>

<p>I might be changing around the aesthetics of the site a little bit more, but I think it has the general look I want.
I sort of need a new headshot.
I have a sketch of my drawn by a friend on the mainpage now just because I'm getting tired of all my profile photos.</p>
