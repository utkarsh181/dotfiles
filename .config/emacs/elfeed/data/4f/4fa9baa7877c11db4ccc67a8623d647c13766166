<p>I'm not a big color person and whenever I have to pick a theme for a website, it sort of annoys me.
I don't like the current theme of my website, in fact, I've never liked <em>any</em> of the themes I've used so I was curious, before I start manually start retinkering with it until I find another scheme I tepidly can approve of,
I was curious if anyone out there who has a knack for design would like to offer me a new .css stylesheet with a better colorscheme and other possible tweaks.
</p>

<p>
The current stylesheet is at <a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/style.css">https://lukesmith.xyz/style.css</a>.
I've added a couple of comments to make clear what novel thing is what.
Feel free to send me new colors for everything, although I want a dark theme.
Be sure that everything still werks, including the rolling blog page. I'll give it a couple days before I pick "a winner" unless I get one really quickly that's just perfect.

Do <b>not</b> offer to redo my website, especially if that means rewriting it with javascript code everywhere!
I also do not want to have to move anything around unless there's just the best reason to: .css changes only.
