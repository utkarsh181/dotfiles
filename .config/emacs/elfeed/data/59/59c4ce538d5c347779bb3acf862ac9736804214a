<p>I put up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4g-du1MIas" target="_blank">this video</a> an hour or so ago, answering some user questions on the terminal usage is so important, and why I often give instructionals for mostly cli/tui/terminal program.</p>

<p>I'll also be having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl9JEsTSWwM" target="_blank">a livestream</a> at the top of the next hour! (about 45 minutes from when I'm writing this). Tune in!</p>

<p>I'll probably be having Rudy on the stream again. You can donate or send messages during the stream or whenever <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/donate.html" target="_blank">by going here</a>.</p>
