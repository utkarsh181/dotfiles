<p>I'm going to probably be doing a video on suckless sent relatively soon, showing it off and some of the patches on suckless's website.
If you use surf, or have had any smart ideas in your own build of it, feel free to go ahead and mention them to me and I might give you a shoutout!</p>

<p>Usually I do a video on something, and obviously afterwards people will volunteer their ideas for the program, but this time, I want to be ahead of the curve. ;-)</p>
