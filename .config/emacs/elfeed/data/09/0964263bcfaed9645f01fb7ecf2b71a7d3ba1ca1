I've push some minor changes and cleaning up to my i3 configs. Several months ago, I was always making huge changes all the time, but now I daresay that I've nearly *perfected* what I'm aiming at...

<p>Changes will still come, but only trickle in as they come to me. By in large, I feel like I've converge on what I've been looking for when I started ricing.

<p>Expect a video on my i3 configs soon. There will be overlap with previous vids, but I feel like this one is much more refined now.
