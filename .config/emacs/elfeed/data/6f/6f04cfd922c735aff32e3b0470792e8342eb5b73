<p>New video up on the pervasiveness of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjbyDU0WzYI">upcummies on social media</a>. Don't know what an upcummy is? Watch the video and find out!</p>

<p>Social media isn't just a waste of time, but makes everyone around you mediocre. Drawn in by a slow trickle of pseudo-information and statistical noise, you constantly have the feeling that you're accomplishing something despite spendings Onaninist hours being conditioned and advertised to.</p>

<p>You can easily go without social media. I, as you may know, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMcX3Fa2Us">went without direct internet access for 2 years</a>, and this YouTube channel is a partial product of that. Restricting your exposure to the hivemind will always make you more clear minded and make your time connected to the hivemind more productive.</p>

<p>Remember to smash that upcummy button too! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p>
