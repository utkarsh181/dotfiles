<p>I'm going to start giving perks, extra videos, personal vlogs and reviews and Mumble server access to people who support me monetarily.
I do have <a href="https://www.patreon.com/lukesmith" target="_blank">a Patreon</a>, which you can support me on, but I've never really done much more than start one, only posted for a brief period and just sort not delete it.
I've never made a fuss about it and I've been at the same level of support for more than a year which is basically just some monthy groecery income, which is nice, but I'd like to start earning more and I have some stuff to offer now.
Obviously I'm not a big fan of Patreon's past behavior, I will use them if needbe, but I was curious about a server-side equivalent.

<p>
I'd like this: a service I can host on my own website that allows users to log in and will verify that they've donated X ammount in the last month by Zelle or Paypal or whatever.
If so, it will give them access to extra content.
As far as I'm concerned, this would be <em>better</em> than Patreon just because it cuts out the Middle Man.
</p>

<p>It isn't too difficult to make password-protected content on a webserver, nor is it too hard to create usernames and passwords for people.
I'm more thinking of if there is a service that can verify a payment.
</p>

<p>If there's nothing quite like this and I can't come across a quick way to do it myself, I'll just end up using Patreon.</p>

<p>By the way, thanks to all of you who answered my previous question about redirecting traffic from a particular source.
Apparently you can refer to a <code>%{HTTP_REFERER}</code> in a RewriteCond. I knew it was something obvious!</p>
