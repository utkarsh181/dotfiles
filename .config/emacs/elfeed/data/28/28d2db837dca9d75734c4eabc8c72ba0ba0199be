<p>I went through the rigamarole of setting up Github Sponsors today.
Basically it's just a built-in funding mechanism using Stripe with Github.
So now people can donate to me from Github and support from/for specific projects.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/">my Github page</a> and you'll see "Sponsor" buttons on my profile and all my main repositories. Hey, free software gotta pay <em>some</em> bills.
Or at least start the expansion cabin...
Did I mention I might be starting a business soon?
Maybe more on that later.</p>

<p>Anyway if you want platform independent ways to donate to me, including direct bank transfers and crypto currency, you can always just see <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">https://lukesmith.xyz</a>.</p>

<p>I always feel like a shill to even say so (or to put the link in video descriptions), but then again, people still come up asking me how to donate. That's how. You have a lot of choices! Thanks for all who do donate; I'd hate to have to resort to selling bath water!</p>
