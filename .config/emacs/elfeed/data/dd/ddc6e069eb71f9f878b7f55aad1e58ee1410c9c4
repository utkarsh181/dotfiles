<p>I've been rehired by the linguistics department (so I'm now working for both them and Information Sciences) and part of my assignment next semester will be making video lectures for an introductory lingusitics course.</p>
		<p>One of the reasons I got this assignment is my history on YouTube, and given that, I'm going to <em>actually</em> end up making the linguistics videos I've been promising here and there.</p>
		<p>The initial content will probably be very introductory, but if I get momentum in making the videos, I'll probably expand the range past what my assignment is.</p>
