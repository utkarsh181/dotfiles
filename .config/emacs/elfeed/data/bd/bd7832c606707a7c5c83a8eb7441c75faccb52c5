<p>I've been on break for a while and am with family (and without my microphone and equipment), so I won't be putting out a video until after Christmas.</p>



<p>
If you want to consoom some classic Luke Smith products in your downtime, YouTube, as is randomly does, has been re-recommending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMcX3Fa2Us">the video I put out quite some time ago on my experience living 2 full years without internet at home</a>.
Come to think of it, I recommend you to watch it if you haven't, or haven't in a while.
It touches on some themes we've been talking about recently on the channel.</p>

<p>
Another older video you might want to see if you haven't is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjbyDU0WzYI">this one, on "upcummies" and the effects of social media</a>.
</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm in Atlanta and will be back home probably the day after Christmas.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas to all, even (especially) to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/87268">the haters and losers</a>!</p>
