<p>I mentioned this in a video or two, but I'll be presenting at Southeast Linuxfest in Charlotte, NC on June 9. Feel free to come if you're in the Southeast. There are actually going to be a lot of talks all weekend, but mine is currently slated for June 9th (Saturday), the last talk of the day.</p>

<p>I should be in town for the full duration of the conference though. I'll also probably be recording the talk as well. I think the conference managers have recorded them in the past, but I want to be sure of the audio quality. Either way, it'll end up on YouTube. That said, for those in neighboring or nearby states, I think it'd be worth your time to come, not just for me, but for all the talks, tutorials, sessions and groups there to choose from.
