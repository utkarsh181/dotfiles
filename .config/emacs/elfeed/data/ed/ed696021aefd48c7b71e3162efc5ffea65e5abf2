<p>Check out the new video out on how to get a domain name.
I list out a couple different registrars in the description, feel free to recommend others if you'd like.
Here's the vid:

	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkV1-BuRrpE">YouTube</a></li>

</ul>

<p>By the way, you may've noticed that I haven't been releasing RSS posts as quickly as I used to when I put out new videos (and even missing some).
There are some practical reasons for this, but in the future, I <em>might</em> go without posting video releases on the blog/RSS, unless I specifically feel like it.
This blog is, after all, supposed to be just a blog.

I'm not sure, but to be extra careful, I recommend subscribing to my YouTube channel's RSS feed here: (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA">https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA</a>).
Entry links will be the direct video links.
