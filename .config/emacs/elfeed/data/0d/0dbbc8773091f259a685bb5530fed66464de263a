You don't have to tell me that I haven't posted in a bit.
I've been working on something big: a service/community for users that I might be making money off of too.
It's been taking up some time, and I've had many things to do in real life recently hence my lack of videos.

I've been learning a lot, and have been nailing out some details, but hopefully I'll be publishing it all soon.
One little, tiny side effect is that there <em>might</em> be a chance of the LARBS script and the site going offline for very short periods: just for maybe a minute at a time.
This isn't a problem unless someone tries to download it right on the exact wrong time!
Just telling you you don't need to be alarmed and tell me, I know.

Additionally, I've gotten some emails congratulating me on hitting 100,000 subscribers today or recently.
That looks true.
Maybe I'll mention it on the YouTube channel when I start putting up videos again.

I guess I always have to tell new viewers that it's a normal thing that I go without putting up a video for a month or so.
They always go apoplectic.
I do it multiple times a year, relax.
