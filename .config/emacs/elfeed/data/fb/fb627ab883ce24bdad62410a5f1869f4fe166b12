<p>You may've already seen that I'll be having a livestream at 4:00 EST. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRp59nDsOz8">The link is here.</a>.</p>

<p>Since the Unaboomer website building stream didn't go public, I've decided to do another basic 1990's-tier plain HTML website stream, this one making <a target="_blank" href="http://yanggang.us">YangGang.us</a>, which will be a classic repository of YangGang memes.
</p>

<p>
Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is the newest, hottest meme as in our increasingly degenerate country, as he has abandoned all pretense and merely promised to give everyone $1,000 a month if elected president.
This has inspired hope among the black-pilled and a $1,000 stipend can go a long way for NEETs and those who choose an /innawoods/ lifestyle.
How can Orange Man even compete?
</p>

<p>Send me any good YangGang memes you run across. Chances are I already have them, but send them just in case.</p>
