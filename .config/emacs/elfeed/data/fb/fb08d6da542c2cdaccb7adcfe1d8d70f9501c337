<p>Hi everyone. You could always use <code>youtube-dl</code> to download my videos and thumbnails, but out of sheer why-not, I've added a link to the fullsize thumbnail of every one of my videos into <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/videos.html">my video gallery</a>.</p>

<p>Just click on the "ðŸ–¼" next to the video title and you'll get the thumbnail.</p>

<p>Also, I released a contentless video <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpzwIArBjyc">here</a> if you want to see it. Just because I've been doing videos pretty consistently the past few days and didn't want to break the pattern despite being very busy today.</p>
