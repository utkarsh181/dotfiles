<p>I recorded some videos while I was gone last week and now that I have internet again, I'll be uploading the vacation.
There are several screencasts and many new episodes of "Boomer Rants in Woods" and "Lunchtime with Luke".
I'll probably be releasing one a day for a while.

First, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJzuJM0h3Zo">29-year-old Boomer LARPs in Woods</a>. I walk through some family land through the river just for exploration. There's a chance in the future I might build something there or maybe move to this area. I'll talk more of my trip later.

<p>By the way, due to some changes YouTube made to how videos are uploaded, my videos will not automatically be appearing on Bitchute for a bit. Hopefully Bitchute will adjust to the changes soon.</p>
