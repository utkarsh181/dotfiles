<p>A big day! I've hit 10,000 subscribers. I had no idea that anyone outside of a couple weebs on 4chan would ever actually see my channel...</p>
		<p>I've come a long way. My two most popular videos (distrohopping and Apple/Mac) were both made before I had <em>100</em> subscribers, now I have a hundred times that, and both those videos are individually at over 130,000 views.</p>
		<p>Looking back at my system of a year ago I can't help shaking my head either; I've improved so much and have brought a lot of people with me on this year-long (but ongoing) journey!</p>
