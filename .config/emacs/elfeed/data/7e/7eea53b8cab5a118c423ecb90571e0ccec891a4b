<p>I recently bought a Slice Battery for my ThinkPad X220, which is a pretty useful tool for all-day cordless use of your ThinkPad. You can get one of these new for around 100 USD, but check out<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cruhiZD2Unw">my video on it</a> for the physical and practical specifics.</p>

<p>It can definitely be useful for many potential workflows and has been very useful for myself so far, but I don't see myself using it every day. I talk about what I do and don't like about it in the video, so check it out.</p>
