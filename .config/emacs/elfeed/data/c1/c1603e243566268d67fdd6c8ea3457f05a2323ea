<p>Just put up a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP2QpHmcgyk">dwmblocks</a> which I've been using for a statusbar for a while now.</p>

<p>Get the build <a href="https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks">here</a>.</p>

<p>It has probably three main advantages over other paradigms for doing statusbars, especially in dwm:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is fully modular and can use independent scripts.</li>
	<li>It doesn't just constantly update: while you can tell a module to update every 5 seconds, you can also tell it only to rerun a script when the program receives and external signal.</li>
	<li>It's clickable. I have each modular run different commands, programs, help panes, etc. for each kind of click.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the last point, you can pretty arbitrarily add in new click sequences in your dwm build as well.
I mention in the video that I have it so if I hold shift while left clicking, the an instance of vim with the module script opens up so you can edit it.</p>
