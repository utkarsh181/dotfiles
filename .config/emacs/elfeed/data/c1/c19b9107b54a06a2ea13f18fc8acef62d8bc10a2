<p>My email adjustments are lasting longer than expected. Right now, if you send an email to me, it will be sucked up into oblivion without an error message.</p>

<p>I am, as you may be able to guess, moving to a new (personal) email server. For a part of late yesterday everything was finally working, but there are some other components I'm working to add in that will again, make my email inaccessible.
As anyone who has done a mail server before knows, there are a lot of annoying moving pieces that go into one, some I'm making sure that everything is just as I need it.</p>

<p>I'll give a public blog post when I'm done with everything just in case someone needs something. If you really need to contact me, you can contact me via my University of Arizona email (lukesmith@email.arizona.edu).</p>
