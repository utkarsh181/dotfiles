<p>I've been contemplating for a while to do a podcast series, partially at the desires of viewers and I think it's now going to happen. The general format is going to be on weekly topics, at the beginning focusing on particular books of political, scientific or other note. I originally was searching around for a co-host, but honestly couldn't find anyone I particularly liked for the job. I'm open to one in the future, but I think I'm setting myself on a detailed monologue format for now.</p>

<p>I've gotten specific requests for books and topics, but it's going to follow only my own instincts in the beginning, focusing mostly on unsung but potent works. The first week, I've pretty much settled on Julian Haynes' <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em> followed by (in no particular order) Schumpeter's <em>Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em>, Feyerabend's <em>Against Method</em>, Hutton's <em>Race and the Third Reich</em> and Nassim Taleb's growing corpus, typically called <em>Incerto</em>.</p>

<p>I'm also open to having non-book based topics or perhaps talking about fiction works. Say, the works of Lovecraft or Dick or Borgres.
Now this isn't supposed to be a bookclub, or a learning experience for me though. I want to focus on works and topics I've been familiar with for years, otherwise it would be pretty silly to put out content.
It would sort of like those people who do "distro" reviews after playing around on a Linux distro for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm still divided on what to call the podcast, but I might just call it <em>No Relation</em> as a joke and allusion to the now famous <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SPD35ETwuk">one episode podcast my roomate and I did</a> last year, and considering it has <em>No Relation</em> to the original.</p>
