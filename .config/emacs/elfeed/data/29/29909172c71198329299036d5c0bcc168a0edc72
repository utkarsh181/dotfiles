<p>The New Year's livestream will be treating a timezone out in the middle of the Atlantic (UTC -2) as the "real New Year".
That is, <b>we will be on the time of <a target="_blank" href="https://time.is/South_Georgia_and_South_Sandwich_Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a></b>.
This is most convenient for me, but also pretty much avoids any personal conflicts most people will have with the climax of the New Year.
I might start as early as 3 hours beforehand, or probably will at least open up the chat while preparing, so these are the times you can come in at:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the Eastern US, that is 6PM to 9PM.</li>
	<li>For the Western US, that is 3PM to 6PM.</li>
	<li>Britain/Portugal: 10PM to 1AM.</li>
	<li>Most of Western Europe: 11PM to 2AM.</li>
	<li>For East Australia: 9AM to noon.</li>
	<li>Etc. etc. Just refer to the link above for the time I'm looking at. Don't trust my math.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no huge plans for the actual moment of the New Year, so feel free to come and leave whenever.
I'll probably open up the chatroom relatively early.
As I said, I'll probably mostly be reviewing the peak moments of 2018 on the channel, playing short meme videos and responding to viewer supercummies and such (<a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/support.html">gibs info here</a>).
