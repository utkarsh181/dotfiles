<p>I put out a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWowqM2S9VU">why I always recommend Manjaro for new users</a>. Get Manjaro at <a href="https://manjaro.org">manjaro.org</a>.</p>

<p>Manjaro has a couple of main benefits over other distros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>While other distros idiotically try to containerize programs allow people to get either normie/proprietary software or very up-and-coming software, Manjaro can just use the AUR.</li>
	<li>The frequent updates give Manjaro a substantial edge over Ubuntu and Linux Mint since it allows noobs to get quick updates to highly-active software areas like gayming.</li>
	<li>On a minor point, pacman is better than apt-get on pretty much any metric.</li>
	<li>Manjaro eases the transfer into Arch Linux, which is a typical rite of passage into mature Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, reading the comments from new users, I am continually reminded that the real hurdle to getting the most out of Linux is a psychological one: most users want to replicate their Windows 10 setup perfectly and more than that, have the mindset of a passive consooomer for whom even the most inconsequential unexpected things on an operating system are a world-ending impossibilities and sources of frustration.
</p>

<p>There's a lot to say about that.
I spend a lot of time making videos to make life easier for other people.
One thing I've realized is that there are some people who get a lot more excitement out of complaining than having solutions to their problems.</p>

<p>I don't understand that psychology, but it's ubiquitous.</p>
