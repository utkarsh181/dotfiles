<p>I took advantage of my weeklong Thanksgiving break to get back in the loop of making some videos I've meant to for a while.
In case you're too intelligent to use YouTube's subscribe feature, I'll link them all here.</p>

<p>Oh course, you can follow my YouTube feed directly with your RSS feed reader (i.e. without having to use YouTube subscription) via the url: <code>https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA</code>, but you knew that already ;).</p>
