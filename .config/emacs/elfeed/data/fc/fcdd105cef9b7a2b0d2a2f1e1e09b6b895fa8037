It's not a huge secret that I'm somewhere in the high echelons of the red-pill, however you define it.
I'll openly talk about pretty any topic that people organically bring up in streams, or that I'm asked about, but I've never really made any kind of political content on my channel, aside from jokes and memes.
That might be surprising because especially three years ago before the mass-bans and algoritm tampering, right wing political channels were a dime-a-dozen and an easily way to get views.
<b>There are two main reasons</b> I never took part.
Arguably "fear of being ZUCCed from YouTube" could be a possible third, but I have a kind intransigence that makes me relish me being banned.
I'm also pretty tired of YouTube, and am increasingly questioning if using it is even a reasonable compromise...
</p>

<p>
So why do I not do political videos?
Why do I not have a set list of deep facts that will blow you away and red-pill you?
The two reasons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reason one: 道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。</li>
	<li>Reason two: You will need politics less than you think.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, reason one there is just the first line of the Daode Jing.
The Daode Jing is the basic book of Daoism (Taoism), and <em>Dao</em> (literally "Way") is an amorphous concept in Chinese thought that could be crudely comparable to Western concepts of "natural order/law" or maybe even "spontaneous order."
<b>"Sounds gay,"</b> you say.
So what does this famous first line mean and how is it relevant to why I don't talk about how to get red-pilled?
I <em>would</em> say it's hard to translate, but even saying that would sound even more pretentious as if I actually know classical Chinese as a native language, but here's a rendering.
</p>

<blockquote><em>The <em>Dao</em> (way) that you can follow isn't the true eternal <em>Dao</em>. A name that you speak, isn't its true name.</em></blockquote>

<p>An aside, it should be a capital offense to translate classical Chinese.
It is so perfect and terse and everything autisitically limited to four elegant syllables that it's just criminal to mutilate it into another language, but we'll forgive it this time.</p>

<p>So what do I mean by quoting this?
I mean that the journey to getting red-pilled is not something that can be explained.
If I could just explain it, tell it to you, it wouldn't be the true story.
It is a varied, and in each case, personal journey, that one goes on.
</p>

<p>
Although you've been lied to, it's not the lies that's the problem.
As an adult, you can a lot of the times tell when the media is manipulating you, especially in the last past decade it's gotten so obvious even a Boomer could see it.
But what you don't see is how when you were lied to (or told selective truths) as a child, you didn't have the same BS-detector, and that allowed a lot of deep-seated impressions about the world to be formed.
So a lot of people who don't believe anything the media says now (rightly) are still mind-cucked.
They accept the programming and differ on the details.
</p>

<p>
I will give you this hint.
Basically all of your programmed emotional responses are your enemies.
There was an old Moldbug blog post where he talked about even far after "awaking from his dogmatic slumber," he still was surprised that if he saw a group of Nazi LARPers, he would reflexively have a pang of emotional stress, but if he saw Stalinist LARPers, he wouldn't have the same kind of emotional reaction.
I think everyone raised in the West has that same programmed reaction.
You might know with your head that the communist death count is supposed to be higher and the suppression wider, but it doesn't click because you weren't made sensitive to it.
</p>

<p>
A good heuristic is whenever you see one of these emotional responses, especially an emotional response to a political term: democracy, equality, racism, feminism, literally all of them actually, <strong>your Pavlovian conditioning is telling you to avoid an intellectual area specifically because it is the ideological weak spot of the background propaganda of modernism.</strong>
If it was not a weak spot, there would be no harm in you being allowed to calmly investigate it.
People's thoughts are regulated in liberal democracy not by laws, but by psychological programming that goes off when someone is tempted to evaluate an idea they're not supposed to.
Okay, actually I guess in Europe they're regulated by that and laws, and it's coming to America very, very soon now.
</p>

<p>
All of this is to say that breaking out of this programming is not so much of an issue of me or anyone else explaining a series of facts to you.
道可道，非常道。
That's what Laozi said.
As cringe as it sounds, it is primarily a battle against yourself, or at least the part of yourself that has eaten up the tacit assumptions of modernism.
<strong>Before you own the libs, you must own yourself.</strong>
Laozi said that too.
</p>

<p>
In case quoting classical Chinese and talking in floating, general terms isn't getting across, I'll say that getting red-pilled is sort of mystical... literally.
Of course, "mystical" in the old, original Greek sense.
A "mystic" in Greek is just a synonym for an "initiate."
Many cultic religions of two millennia ago where like modern Freemasonry: not a ideology one could just go and read about on Wikipedia, but one where people were slowly initiated in the thought and mindset of the religion over time.
While people were born into Paganism, they were <em>initiated</em> into Gnosticism, Hermeticism or even early Christianity.
The only difference is that you are being initiated <em>out</em> of the cultural bubble of modernism.
Into what? It can vary person to person, experience to experience.
You'll always be in some bubble, so don't be arrogant, but you will be out of the big bubble that's going to pop everywhere and is dominated by liberal cat-ladies, professors, sanctimonious NGO-members and journalists.
</p>

<p>
All of this is to say that it is simply impossible for me to provide you direct direction.
Even direction might sound stupid before or after.
Maybe I can lay out some random disorganized recommendations.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
Years ago as young college student, I remember reading <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/steven+pinker+blank+slate">Steven Pinker's <em>Blank Slate</em></a> (<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=blank+slate+steven+pinker">dl</a>) and thinking I was finally red-pilled.
Now I think Steven Pinker is a moron (that book and only that book of his is good, the rest is beyond garbage).
I've actually met many people for whom this book was the first step away from basic boomer-tier progressivism.
I suspect that Pinker almost regrets writing this book because he's actually very basic in politics.
He wrote it back before the elite recognized any threat of a resurgence of energy on the right.
	</li>
	<li>
I think everyone knows that <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/files/unabomber.pdf">Uncle Ted's manifesto</a> is another favorite on my channel.
I never read it until long after I needed it, but since it's a meme now I should recommend it explicitly.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you're prepped for harder stuff <a href="https://radishmag.wordpress.com/archive/">Radishmag</a> has it. This one <em>tries</em> to evoke that programmed emotional response in a devilish way, but it might be exactly the next step with plenty of actual original sources on historical articles to follow up with.
	</li>
	<li>
		Everything <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/nassim%20taleb">Nassim Taleb</a> has written is good.
		He might be the only living author worth reading now in fact, which isn't saying <em>that</em> much considering our age, but Taleb is pretty based and has attracted a constellation of non-retarded people who employ the very useful concepts he's popularized: antifragile, Lindy, buttercuck... (okay maybe the last one he didn't coin himself, but I'm buttercucked and proud).
		Read his books before you even look up videos of him or shadow him on social media.
		His books are lucid, but you won't get it based on mere social media.
		He also has no patience for brainlets.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, you can be red-pilled too quickly and end up like that guy in the Matrix who looks like me and betrays his friends so he can be put back in the matrix to have nice juicy steaks again.
Did he make an appearance in Runescape as well?
</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote more of this than I thought I was going to, and <strong>I never got to reason two!</strong>
I'll write it tomorrow after church.
You can read it once you get back from church providing it isn't banned where you live.</p>

<p>
Speaking of church, for those interested in early Christian theology, or frankly Greek philosophy generally, notice how similar 名 <em>name/word</em> "m&iacute;ng" in the Chinese above is equivalent to <em>logos</em>.
In fact, 名 is even used both in the particular sense "the name that you speak" as I render it, and in the universal abstract sense of <em>logos</em>.
This pun, which doesn't exist in English without some explanation, does exist in both classical Chinese and Greek.
More on that later.
