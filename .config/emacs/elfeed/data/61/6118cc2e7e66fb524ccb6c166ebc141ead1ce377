<p>New video up today: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E8sUNHdzG8" target="_blank">"Layin' down Pippes like a Unix Chad"</a>.</p>

<p>It's a simple demonstration of the elegance of pipe-based commands and drawing userinterface from them: using a single line of shell script, I produce a list of all manuals on the system, ask the user to choose one and pop up a pdf rendering of that manual page.</p>

<p>The specific use-case might be useful to some, but that's actually not the importance of the video. It's really an attempt to make the usefulness and intuitiveness of editing text streams clear.</p>
