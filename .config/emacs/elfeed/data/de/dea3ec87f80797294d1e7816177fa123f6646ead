You can't see any changes on my actual website, but I've just implemented a totally new paradigm for editing and updating it.</p>

		<p>I hate the internet. I like not being connected. But I pretty often have ideas for what to add to my website when I'm outside of the WWW.</p>

		<p>Traditionally, I just had to remember what I wanted to change and do it when I came back into the realm of wifi, but now I'm just keeping an entire "repository" of my website on my computer here.</p>

		<p>I can edit it offline, and when I get back to a reliable connection, I "push" the changes with rsync via ssh.</p>

		<p>There are other huge advantages to this as well. I don't have to worry about maintaining another vimrc on the serverside, and I don't have to worry about the lag common over ssh. Plus, I have an extra little backup in case of disaster with Host Gator.</p>

		<p>All in all, a good development.</p>
