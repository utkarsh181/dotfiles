<p>I've officially created a new playlist for a certain genre of my videos: the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRlxgcaj-WxkAylXFuE0gyk">"30-year-old Boomer Rants in Woods"</a> series.</p>

<p>
Title self explanatory, although the Boomer-ranting-in-woods should be understood as a Gestalt that might include some videos that are not, strictly speaking, <em>rants</em>, some scenes that are not actually in <em>the woods</em> and additionally, I'm neither <em>actually</em> a Boomer nor 30-years-old.</p>

<p>For those of you who use YouTube playlists, you may now enjoy this one.</p>
