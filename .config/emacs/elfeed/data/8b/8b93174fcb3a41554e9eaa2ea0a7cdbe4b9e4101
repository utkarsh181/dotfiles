<p>I've put up two videos on imagemagick today and yesterday covering some of the basics from making canvases and composites and basic effects. You can check the first out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETumamLjFbg">here</a> and the second <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbXHbHrfrIs">here</a>. Imagemagick is one of the most useful programs out there, and can be a huge boon for automated imageprocessing and also making little modifications (like resizing and minor adjustment).</p>

<p>I'll be doing more like this just because of imagemagick being such a huge and useful world. Specific ideas are welcome.</p>
