I've settled back home after an abnormally long trek across country. Now that I have, I've started to accumulate the tools I'll need to begin Librebooting or Corebooting machines via Rasberry Pi.<p>

Some materials are still shipping, and I'm not 100% sure how long it will take for preparation, but I'm hoping to have at least a video Corebooting my X220 up by the time our classes begin this time next month.
