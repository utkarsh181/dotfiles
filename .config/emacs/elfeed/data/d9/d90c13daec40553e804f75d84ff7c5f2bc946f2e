<p>You know what, I released yet another video today, this one on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1czUp-MvWvE">"""rationality"""</a> or at least on how the term is clumsily understood.
</p>

<p>
I have a lot of videos slated for release soon and I honestly forgot about this one today, I suppose in conjunction with <a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/blog/new-git-repo-greek-septuagintnew-testament-on-the-command-line.html">my last post</a>, this constitutes a bad day for all Reddit-tier fedorafriends out there!
</p>

<p>I talk about the limits to how people commonly misunderstand rationality and how we often find ourselves in destructive logical holes when we too blindly assume that the straight-jacket of formal logic corresponds to the world out there.</p>

<p>To go a little more in depth, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://notrelated.libsyn.com/when-youre-too-rational-to-be-rational">one of my recent podcast episodes on the same topic</a>.
There I talk about Kahneman and Tversky's Heuristics and Biases program and Ecological Rationality &agrave;la Gigerenzer.
