<p>It was only just reported to me that the GUIDs generated by my RSS feeds weren't directly correctly, and haven't been for a while. I've fixed the problem in the <code>lb</code> repository in the future, but to fix it retroactively, I've changed the problematic GUIDs of my previous blog entries.</p>

<p>So this probably means that many, many of my previous blog posts are now duplicated in your RSS reader. Clean out your RSS reader's cache to fix this.</p>


<p>If you've been using <code>lb</code> and have noticed the same problem, just run this on your RSS feed to fix it in the same way:</p>

<pre><code>sed -i "s/\.html&lt;\/guid/&lt;\/guid/" yourrssfeed.xml</code></pre>
