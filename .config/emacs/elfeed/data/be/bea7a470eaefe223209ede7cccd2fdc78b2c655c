<p>I've just put up a video on some general tips I have for people who are looking to use suckless programs. </p>

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C6saSpX4KQ">YouTube</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/3C6saSpX4KQ/">Bitchute</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is in response to a lot of the complaints I hear about suckless from people who are trolling their minds for reasons not to use it.
I also saw that Distrotube had put out a video talking about trying suckless utilities out, so I wanted to give my personal recommendations.
