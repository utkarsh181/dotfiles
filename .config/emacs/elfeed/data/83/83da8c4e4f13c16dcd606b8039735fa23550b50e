<p>I've put up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybWUK1dGRm8" target="_blank">a new Lunchtime with Luke episode</a>, this one on the (dumb) idea that there is a natural and unavoidable trend to history.</p>

<p>Every ideology convinces itself of its inevitability.
In this video, I talk about the myth of inevitability: in the Third Reich with Rosenberg's <em>Myth of the Twentieth Century</em>, in Marxism, in the "End of History" in Liberal Democracy and more.
Check it out!</p>
