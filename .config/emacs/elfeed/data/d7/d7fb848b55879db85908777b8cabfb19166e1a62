<p>Since people don't austistically check my Github commits, I get a lot of questions about st (the simple terminal by suckless), my build and feature requests.
Actually, a lot of people seem to think I'm still using urxvt...</p>

<p>Anyway, I've put up <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/9H75enWM22k">a new video on st here</a>, which is a complement to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJmm7wl4JUI">my original video</a>.
I talk about some of the additional features I've patched in, like reading variables, including font and colors from Xresources, more intuitive vim-like binds, and a binding that reads all urls on the screen and feeds them to dmenu for selection.
The last feature can largely replace using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgzpAjFgbCw">urlview</a> or urlscan, although it requires xurls (and dmenu).</p>

<p>To be clear, reading Xresources does make st compatible with automatic pywal colorschemes (if you don't know what wal/pywal is, I did a video on it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es79N_9BblE">here!</a>).
I've actually had this in my st build for a while now, but I still get requests for this feature!
