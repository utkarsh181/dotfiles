<p>I've had some requests to put up some addresses for other cryptocurrencies, so on my <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/crypto.html">donate Crypto page</a>, you'll now see addresses for Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash in addition to the typical Bitcoin.
</p>

<p>
Due to some changes in how I do my crypto, there's actually a different Bitcoin address there too and I'll be moving all the old funds to the new address. You can donate to either, but I'm only including the new address on the page.
</p>

<p>
I might put up some QR codes for each address later if some people have to have them.
