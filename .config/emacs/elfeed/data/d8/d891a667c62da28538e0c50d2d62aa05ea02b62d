<p>I've decided to put up a <a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/wishlist.html">"Hacking Wishlist"</a>, which will be a running list of all the things I need or would like to know how to do, but don't yet know.
I've started it with two big problems I've had for a while and am looking for any clues as to how to solve them.
<a target="_blank" href="https://lukesmith.xyz/wishlist.html">Check out the list!</a>
</p>

<p>The first I need to solve is to make LARBS's pausing system and lock screen better, and the second I really want for mutt-wizard to make it easier for users to add new mail accounts.</p>

<p>
I'll post updates as I add more entries to the list or me or someone else solves one.
You can, of course, email your solutions to <a href="mailto:luke@lukesmith.xyz">luke@lukesmith.xyz</a>.
