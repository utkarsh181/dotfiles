A lot of people asked for a video on <em>zathura</em> the document reader after I mentioned I used in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=158bJFTETRI">in a recent video where I complained about the acursed Adobe Reader</a>.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_Iz4zdyRM4">Here it is!</a></p>

<p>Zathura is great because:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It's vim-based and the shortcuts can be easily configured.</li>
	<li>It is very small, modular and a very quick load and quite responsive.</li>
	<li>It provides keyboard access to zooming, bookmarking, indexes and everything in between.</li>
	<li>It autodetects changes in currently open files.</li>
	<li>It can read standard input, which I discuss a recent use case of mine.</li>
	<li>It can also function modally for giving presentations and other things.</li>
	<li>It's modular and can be easily expanded to read pdfs, djvus, postscript files, epubs, comic books, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check the video, and the program out!</p>
