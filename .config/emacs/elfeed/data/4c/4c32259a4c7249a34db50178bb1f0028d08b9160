<p>Today was my first full day of my weeklong outing, and I spent a lot of the time walking through the pines and on firelanes.
I went to visit some family land by the river, which had been partially flooded with some residual marshland.
There's a non-negligible chance that in the future I might be building a house on that parcel, albeit much further away from the river for fear of the occasional hurricane-based flooding.

<p>I also visited the church cemetary where many of my ancestors are buried.</p>

<p>I did have the chance to record some material for videos, but I won't be able to upload it until I either get back or drive quite a while to get to an area with public internet.
Out here, the main way people even have an internet connection is via satillite.
Dial-up was common relatively recently.

I didn't mention it yesterday, but the "urbanization" of the area is somewhat jarring.
I mean "urbanization" in the loosest sense (I'm not quite sure what to call it, perhaps "commercialization"), but a lot of the small towns in the area have started to produce Subways, McDonalds, chain gas stations and even a couple of Walmarts.
The essence of the area hasn't changed that much, but it could mean the beginning of a potentially irreversable process.
Still, where I am is imminently rural, without the hint of even a non-chain restaurant or a grocery store for miles and miles.

When I was young, my grandfather used to arrange for gasoline to be shipped to a tank on our property, but that was a long time ago.
If you wanted to go "shopping", you'd have to drive more than an hour to get to Valdosta, which in the grand scheme of things is still a relatively small college town, although I much confess that that city has balooned in size and business in the 10 years since I did my first year of college there in 2008-2009.
