<p>I've been preparing for my oral defense in my doctoral program and some other things recently, adding up to one of the more full months I've had in a while. (So if you're curious why I haven't been putting up as much as usual, that's why). For those who don't know what this means, I wrote two qualifying papers as required for my PhD, and afterwards, our department requires an oral defense of both of them, in front of a committee of my choosing from the department.</p>

<p>For those who want to know, my committee is Mike Hammond, Tom Bever, Massimo Piatelli-Palmarini, Simin Karimi and Robert Henderson. The only one who non-linguists may be familiar with is Massimo, notorious for his book "What Darwin Got Wrong" with Jerry Fodor, but a couple of the others might have a Wikipedia article or talks on YouTUbe if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>Anyway, after passing this, I'll be officially allowed to start on my dissertation (and after finishing that, I'll be doing another defense of that). I was sort of thinking of recording this defense for public consumption, although I don't think I'm strictly speaking allowed to, as the event is supposed to be private. (I think this has traditionally been just for the privacy of the defender, which I obviously don't care about).</p>

<p>After this is over, I'll the ABD (all but dissertation, as they say) and will have more time on my hands.</p>
