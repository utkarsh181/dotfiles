<p>I've put up a video on the basics of GIMP, which you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m8Oaz8XWVI">here</a>.</p>

<p>I may do more in the future, but even better, I'm going to be doing some videos on Imagemagick (I already have one recorded which I'll release over the weekend). For those who don't know, Imagemagick is a core system for image creating and editing that accessible on the command line. It's hard to full express how useful IM is, so the first video will be just on one of my implementations of it.</p>
