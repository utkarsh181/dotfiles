<p>I'll be at Linuxfest Southeast June 12-14, 2020 in Charlotte, NC. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6JXNZQwoYE">vid</a>).
I'll probably be making some presentations as well.
Although I missed the 2019 conference, I had gone in 2018 and it was a good experience.
</p>

<p>If you're in the region, I recommend you come.
I'll be commuting from a distance, but I expect it will be worth it.
I met a lot of subscribers in 2018 (and there were many more who were too awkward to come up and greet me ðŸ˜‰).
</p>

<p>Anyway, check out their website at <a href="https://southeastlinuxfest.org/">southeastlinuxfest.org</a>.
I don't think they've opened sing-up for attendence, but I expect it to be in a month or so.</p>

<p>By the way, if you want to see my talk at the 2018 Linuxfest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnCXJn2cRf4">the link is here: Linux Is the Wild West! And let it be that way!</a>.</p>
