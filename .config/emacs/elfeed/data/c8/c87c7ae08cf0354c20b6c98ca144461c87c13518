<p>I've long found conversations about different Linux distributions tedious and meangingless.
For people familiar enough with *nix systems, the superficial differences between distributions can be easily erradicated or changed by any basic system knowledge.
"Distros are not desktop environments", as some people have started to say.
I sort of got this ball rolling on YouTube at the start of my channel when I put out my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zpgQpdy_fI">How to Choose a Linux distro: Stop Thinking!</a> video and it was the first result for any "Linux" search for a while.

I certainly don't take any of it back, but as time has gone on, I'm starting to think that the distribution I've been using for all this time might be "the best" in some sense.
It doesn't do anything <em>particularly good</em>, but avoids all the hassles that most distributions do not.
It also puts users in a place where they can more competently deal with system problems in an intelligent way.
