<p>Yesterday and just a bit ago I put out two videos of extreme relevance if you want to script efficiently:</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5phSVBEHhQ">the first</a> formally was about writing a network traffic module without dependencies, we talking about the file location of network information, shell arithmatic and some other efficiencies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXineadwG4E">The second video</a> is on an important trick for getting a substring from a string without having to call separate programs like <code>awk</code> or <code>cut</code>, and thus saving time.
That is, <em>substring removal</em>, which you've probably seen before. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo "${fullfilename%.*}"</code></pre>

<p>That particular command will echo a file name removing its extension.
I explain the logic of what all the symbols mean and how to manipulate them in the video.
