<p>Now that the forum is being reborn, I've openned up one of the subforums, the <a target="_blank" href="http://forum.lukesmith.xyz/forumdisplay.php?fid=5">tech support</a> one to non-registered posters. This makes it so people without an account can come and ask questions.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm going to give perks to people who support me/the channel on Patreon. For now, it's going to be for anyone who gives any ammount of money, but I make increase the required input in a bit. Perks will include a gold-plated name, access to a private forum, and possibly other abilities like bigger avatar size and such (that's not implemented yet).</p>
