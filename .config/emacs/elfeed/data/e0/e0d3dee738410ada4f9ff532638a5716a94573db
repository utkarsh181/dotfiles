<p>I've been unofficially aiming to release a <em>Not Related</em> episode every week at the end of week, but the THICC book I'm covering this time required a lot of prep, and it's not out yet as you can see! It will be out tomorrow.</p>

<p>I've already recorded <em>an hour and twenty minutes</em>, which requires a lot of stopping and rerecording and audio fixes.
As I'm still acclimating to recording this takes a lot of time, but as I improve my process, I'm hoping to record episodes in one run without splicing necessary.

<p>Anyway, just saying this because I haven't forgotten about it and I've been working a lot. I'll have yet another episode out later in the week.</p>
