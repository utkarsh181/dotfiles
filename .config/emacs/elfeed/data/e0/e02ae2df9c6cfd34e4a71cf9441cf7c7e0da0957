<p>Come June, I'll be moving to a rural environment with plenty of space, and as soon as possible, I'll be starting a garden that will hopefully be able to produce all the produce I need in perpetuity, although I obviously expect a lot of set-up time and effort.</p>

<p>
The thing is, there are a lot of ins-and-outs and details that I just don't know about growing a garden: what is best to plant when, what plants reinforce others, how long does a plant take to get to maturity.
I'd like a physical book reference with all the major details for growing the most common fruits and vegetables, possibly along with other information that I don't even know that I don't know.

I'm curious if there is "that book" out there for gardening and planting. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to email me it (luke@lukesmith.xyz).
It would be extremely handy to have such a book to leaf through and use as a reference.

<p>I suspect that there is one out there, probably a very #Lindy book too.
That is, don't send me some meme book published two years ago by a quirky gardening YouTuber with a glossed and plastic cover printed by Amazon, send me what that tried-and-true dusty manual is loved by old pre-Boomers.
