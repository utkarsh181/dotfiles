<p>Alright, it's that time of year where I have to start finalizing my research projects, which means I'll be really hard-pressed for time. If that means anything, it's that I'll probably be producing <em>more</em> content than usual.</p>

		<p>I'm the kind of person who when in a pinch goes the extra mile, which is good now just because I've been putting out a whole lot less content than I had wanted this semester. Good news is (a) I now have the will to do more hardcore video editing and (b) I found a way to cheat!</p>

		<p>That said, I do have a lot of personal work to finish, two qualifying papers, a paper on the evolution of rationality, a corpus of Latin and probably some other stuff I've forgotten. For me that just means more limitations, and thus more motivation for output I'll probably also put out videos on my academic projects, but only as a little bonus.</p>

		<p>First things first, I have a series on de-Googling coming soon, with a couple videos coming out next week.</p>
