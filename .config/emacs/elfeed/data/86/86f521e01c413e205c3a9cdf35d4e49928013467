<p>I was playing around with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/seebye/ueberzug">ueberzug</a>, which is a possbly more consistent replacement for the w3m image preview.
Give it an images and a location/dimensions for it and it will print it to the terminal.
The preview will survive after multiple resizing, mouse away and anything else.
Much more robust than w3mimg.
</p>

<p>A brief example in bash. I recommend installing ueberzug via pip to ensure all the right dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>source "`ueberzug library`"
ImageLayer
declare -A command=([path]="pix/image.png" [identifier]="name" [action]="add" [x]="0" [y]="0" [max_width]="400" [height]="400")</code></pre>

<p>The above will print <code>pix/image.png</code> in the top left (0x0) and ensure it fits within 400x400 by resizing it.
If you spawn a bunch more windows and move it around, the image is very consistent.
</p>

<p>Now vifm does provide some built-in arguments for the size of the preview window and location, but despite a little tinkering, I couldn't actually get any previews to pop up.
I tried in my build of st, urxvt and alacritty and none worked in vifm.
</p>

I could toy around with it a little more and figure it out, but if any of you guys have already done it, feel free to share your script/command to do it.
Ideally I'd like vifm previews, but also an independent script that could simply print out an image argument to the command line.
