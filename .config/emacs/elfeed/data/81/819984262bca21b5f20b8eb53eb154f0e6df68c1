<p>Title says it all. <a href="https://videos.lukesmith.xyz">videos.lukesmith.xyz</a> was only offline for an hour or so before I managed to migrate everything over.
If there are any errors in the meantime, feel free to tell me.</p>

<p>It looks like everyone's accounts have synced over and it still has all of its following instances. Great.</p>

<p>The next step is that I want to do a full sync with all my videos on YouTube including banned and privated ones. I'll be scripting that soon, so you might see literally hundreds of videos randomly being added to the instance in the next day or so.</p>
