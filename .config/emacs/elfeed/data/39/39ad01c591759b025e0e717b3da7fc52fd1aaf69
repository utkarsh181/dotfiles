<p>As the kick off to the creating-a-website series, I'm going to be having what was originally going to be an "HTML/CSS tutorial", but since everyone already knows HTML and CSS, it's going to be a light-heared Geocities-themed livestream where I construct an early-ninties-style webpage.
</p>

<p>Typical livestream behavior expected as well.</p>
