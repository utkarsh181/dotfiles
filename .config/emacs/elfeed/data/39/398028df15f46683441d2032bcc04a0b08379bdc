I've had some backups of earlier videos on <a href="https://vid.me/LukeSmith">Vid.Me</a> for a while, but with all the ZUCCing going on with Google and YouTube, I figure it's best to keep more recent back ups as well.

		<p>Thankfully, Vid.Me always for pretty easy migration of YouTube videos, without me having to reentrer metadata, so it should be pretty easy to upkeep everything.
