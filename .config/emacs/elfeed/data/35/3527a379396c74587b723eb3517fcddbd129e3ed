<p>Late yesterday I put up a follow-up video to Friday's video on piping: the update is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_37upFE-qw">here</a>. I give a pratical example of two of the biggest pitfalls for cli newbies: problems with spacing and understanding streams. We write a command that gives you a choice of all videos in a directory from which you can select and watch one.</p>


<p>I also just released a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRNKjQg6y-c">"Everything I Want to Do Is Illegal"</a> on the book by Joel Salatin by the same name.
Superficially, it might not sound too relevant to too many of my subscribers' interests, but I think you'll find it pretty important.</p>
