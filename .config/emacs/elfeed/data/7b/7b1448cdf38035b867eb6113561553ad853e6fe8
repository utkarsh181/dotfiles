<p>I mentioned making a forum for subscribers and I've been working on it a little for the past few days. The link is at <a href="https://forum.lukesmith.xyz/">https://forum.lukesmith.xyz/</a>. I haven't posted this on YouTube or Twitter yet, but I'll go ahead and tell all of you who follow my RSS feed now.</p>

<p>Registration should be free and open and you should be able to post on the boards I've made so far, so feel free to, if fact, please do and go ahead and find any bugs, start dialogue etc. If everything works out, I'll probably announce it on the channel next week.</p>
