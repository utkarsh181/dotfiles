<p>I've actually done several mutt-related videos in the past, but none detailing the basics of how you actually go about configuring it from step 1.
I might make some related videos in the future, mainly about using isync to backup email offline.</p>

<p>If you want to use mutt, but don't have the time to bother with it, I've made a mutt-wizard which I've actually been revising recently.

</ul>

<p>The Gitlab version is more recent, and uses <code>isync</code> as a backend with many improvements.
The Github version I'll be taking out of commission soon, but it's better tested as of now.
Check the README for information and try it out for yourself!</p>
