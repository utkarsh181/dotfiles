<p>I'm a completionist, so I've been in a habit of putting everything out there in full form.
One of these things is my RSS feed, where I've never bothered to purge old entries.
This was inevitable, but it's getting too big! Over 200 entries since last summer when I started it!</p>

<p>So pretty soon, probably today, I'll be removing old entries from the feed and backing them up somewhere else.
I'll probably have a backup for the old RSS feed though.
Of course, you'll still have everything if your RSS reader keeps a cache and you don't need to change the address or anything else.
I just wanted to make this note, before I trim it down. It's about 215K now! Considering how many people access it and how often it's way too much of a bandwidth hog.</p>
