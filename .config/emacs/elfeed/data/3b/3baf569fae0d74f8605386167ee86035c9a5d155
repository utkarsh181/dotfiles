<p>I'm going to start offering elite stuff to donators:
<ul>

	<li>I've started a Mumble server, which allows people to talk to me directly via audio and text. People who donate $10 a month will get access to it.</li>
	<li>I'll be starting a "Dispatches from the Unaboomer's Cabin" series, covering my ongoing quest to move /innawoods/. The first episode(s) will go up at least by early next week. Donate $25 in a month to see the updates.</li>
	<li>People who are chad enough to donate $50 a month will get all that stuff, and also an invitation onto the livestream. So we can talk live on air and you can move the discussion without me brushing aside your $2 superchat ;-).</li>
	<li>There are many unreleased videos I've had over the years or other content that is more private or just not necessarily YouTube material. I'll be making a lot of one-off stuff available to different tiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/lukesmith" target="_blank">Go to Patreon to join now.</a> The Mumble passwords will be up in a couple days (actually maybe later today if everything goes right).
</p>

<p>
If you don't have or don't want to get a Patreon, if you say you want one of the perks in the comment of a Paypal or Zelle donation (be sure to include your email too), I will give you that month's password.
<a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/donate.html">All donation methods are listed here.</a>
That's a little more work for me though, so Patreon is preferred at this point.
</p>

<p>I'll also say what I did in the Patreon post: I am looking at some open source equivalents to Patreon that can be run on my own server.
In the future, I might switch to one of these if I can get them to do everything I need, but if I do, everything on Patreon will carry over, so don't sweat it.
</p>

<p>I'll probably do a video saying all this tomorrow or the next day when I have the chance, but I wanted to offer it to RSS chads first of course.</p>
