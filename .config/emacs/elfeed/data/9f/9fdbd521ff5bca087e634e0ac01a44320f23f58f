<p>After several months and 70-something commits, I decided to hard reset and recommit my voidrice repository. Nothing's gone of course, there are a lot of forks and mirrors out there and I'm recommiting the files as they are today.</p>
		<p>This might sound like a strange thing to do, but the repo files were getting huge (around 20MB for a repo for less than 2MB of files). I tried all the typical options, garbage collecting, even tree filtering, but couldn't reduce the size, and a small size is what I need for LARBS.</p>
		<p>The main reason it got so big was when I na√Øvely included an enormous font system with the repo a while back to make it more accessible to Parabola users. I didn't realize how much of a pain it would be to deal with for its ease.</p>
		<p>I'm planning a bigger, fuller release of LARBS, so I want to have everything clean and accessible. I may upload the old bloated repository as well on Github, maybe a "voidrice classic" and keep it as it is now, but there's a lot I've learned about system management so I like the clean feeling.</p>
