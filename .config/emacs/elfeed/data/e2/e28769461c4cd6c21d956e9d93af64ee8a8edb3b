Just in case there are actually any subsribers of mine who use the DRM-content-restriction manager Spotify, you can now get my podcast on it, see <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6uiBcDPySNPQGRVOXb88sR">this link</a>!
Obviously I don't condone using Spotify, but if you already use it and have clever rationalizations as for why you just have to ;-), you can now get the podcast through it as syndicating it there is costless and effortless to me.

There are, of course, better ways of getting the podcast, including RSS on the podcast website: <a target="_blank" href="https://notrelated.xyz">https://notrelated.xyz</a>
