<p>I've put up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCiJO8BaSSk">a video on getting/reading/searching the Bible, in English, Greek or Latin, on the command line</a>.
I mentioned this on the blog a week or so ago, but I had forked <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bontibon/kjv">this repository</a>, which included a very economical sh/awk script that can parse and interface with a tsv file to give you a very intuitive and light interface to the Bible or any other versified text you need.
</p>

<p>My personal repos on this are below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/kjv">A fork of `kjv` including the Apocrypha</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/grb">The Greek Bible with the Septuagint for the Old Testament and the SBL for the New</a></li>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vul">The Clementine Vulgate Bible (Latin)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, this system isn't just useful for religious texts, but anything that is divided into books, chapters and verse.
Feel free to implement the system in whatever way you like.

<p>By the way, yesterday, I put out a idle video on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyEljFoPnpU">a trip I made to George L. Smith Park</a>, nothing too deep, but I figured I might record and put it up.</p>
