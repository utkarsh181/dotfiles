<p>The newest podcast episode (direct link <a target="_blank" href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/notrelated/S01E01_-_The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind.mp3">here</a>) is on the <em>true</em> Bronze-Age Mindset, well, sort of. It's on <b>Julian Jaynes</b>' theory of the <b>"Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"</b>, which amounts to arguing that humans before the Bronze Age Collapse were, in fact, not conscious among many other wild, yet surprisingly justifiable things.</p>

I'll also have a YT video equivalent of the podcast, which will be available tomorrow morning at <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lgnMyF-o0sQ">https://youtu.be/lgnMyF-o0sQ</a>.</p>
