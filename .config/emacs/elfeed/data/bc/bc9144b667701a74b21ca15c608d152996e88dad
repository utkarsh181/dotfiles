<p>I've put up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btHano6wHgA" target="_blank">this video</a>, where I answer a common question I get: Why should a normal person care about free/libre and open source software?</p>

<p>I put it as a response to an email I got, which makes some seemingly good points for not caring about the difference, so I state give a rejoinder and explanation.</p>
