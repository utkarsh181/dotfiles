<p>I had actually been planning to release videos every day this week, but I've been having severe internet issues.
The ISP in our town has been laying new wires as well and for whatever reason even the internet in town seems to be running slower.
I've had the same video uploading since noon Thursday (lol).</p>

<p>I'm always looking for a more permanent internet solution, but it looks like I might have to postpone by videos a little bit until I can get everything uploaded.</p>

<p>This has been one inconvenience.
When I lived in a larger town, I had 30 megs up and could wake up, come up with a video idea and record and have it uploaded before 10AM.
For the last year, uploading videos is a full or multi-day affair.</p>
