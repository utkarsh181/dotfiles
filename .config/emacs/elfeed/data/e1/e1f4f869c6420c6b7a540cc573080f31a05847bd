<p>Now onto the second point I didn't get to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/2020.html#why-do-i-so-rarely-talk-about-politics-on-my-channel">in my post yesterday</a>: politics only matters so much when you're a slave. Or as I put it there, "You will need politics less than you think."</p>

<p>
That is to say that if you live in a city where your every action is watched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social media services, if you have no marketable skills because you have some inert degree and questionably productive and definitely replaceable job and a large company, you need politics quite a great deal.
</p>

<p>
Your entire existence in the system is based on being a good boy within the established boundaries of what is deemed by the mass media to be socio-politically appropriate.
<em>Maybe</em> you've gone into debt, but you <em>definitely</em> rely the whole "system" for all the basics.
If you don't think you do, just ask yourself whether your life has changed for the better after the Coronachan Panic of 2020.

<p>
What's the alternative?
Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVmfx4EWI0">boomer rants viewers might see some of this coming</a>...
</p>

<p>
The fact of the matter is that both the daily ins-and-outs of politics and the overarching trends of politics matter very little the more independent your are of the system.
Earlier, I always mumbled about how conservaboomers seemed a little too apathetic about the cultural changes being forced on them.
This social engineering still is the most serious problem in all technologically-complex mass-media societies, but I must admit for people who choose personal independence and independence for their families and local communities, it is much less of a problem.
</p>

<p>
When I was plugged into the system, minorly red-pilled and generally peeved because I actually paid attention to the media as something other than to laugh at, I found the idea of Political "Exit" pretty cucky.
How much sense does it make to leave the "political process" altogether?
Sounds like giving up.
</p>

<p>
It sounds like giving up because the "political process" is something internal to the media system at large.
That's why even when the political process does something the media doesn't like (like electing the Orange Boomer, for example), its actions are immediately rendered inert by fakery.
</p>

<p>
The actual solution is creating and participating in organic society, which still very much exists outside the purview of the media and NGOs and the like.
People still need plumbers.
No one is going to fire a plumber because he says trannies are mentally ill men in dresses&mdash;otherwise there'd be no plumbers. Or electricians, or builders or anyone who actually does anything productive.
It'd just be HR, journalists and professors left...
and some open source developers who write more codes of conducts than they do software.
Do you think they'll be able to feed you?
</p>

<p>
Exiting the system is actually the opposite of surrender.
Why would you think the solution is something like voting or even "owning the libs" or something publicly advertised as a solution?
The actual solution is building an alternative.
Or maybe <em>rebuilding</em> the alternative.
</p>

<p>
Do you really want to make your boss rich if you think he'd turn around and betray you because of a media witchhunt?
It's better for you to be doxxed and fired now rather than wait 20 years for it, getting more ensconced in the insanity.
Start becoming more independent now.
</p>

<p>
A lot of people LARP about what they're going to do when they take over "the system" by revolution.
Revolution, the idea of abrupt enforced change, however, is fundamentally their idea and if you buy it, you're going to keep running your head into a wall.
</p>

<p>
Being independent, living out of the city and the Matrix, however, is simultaneously like transporting yourself back in time to when things were saner, but at the same time, transporting yourself into the future where "the system" has already collapsed and we're already rebuilding.
Be a part of it now rather than later.
