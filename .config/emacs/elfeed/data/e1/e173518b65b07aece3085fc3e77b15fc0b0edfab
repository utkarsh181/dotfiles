<p>I installed Deus Ex (yes, of course the original) on my Arch Desktop, just for laughs and because I wanted to quickly replay and get tired of it. Installation on Linux wasn't too difficult since there's an OpenGL renderer from the Mac port, and aside from that all I needed to install was some lib32 pulseaudio/alsa things. It runs really smooth and clean on a Linux machine if it means anything.</p>

<p>Don't expect me to end up becoming a game streamer, especially with (&gt;proprietary software), but it was fairly refreshing to play a game with genuinely good storyline and development again. Obviously it lacks the features of a modern game, but back then video games were far enough away from real life so that you could rely on your imagination to fill in the gaps, which arguably makes for a better experience.</p>
