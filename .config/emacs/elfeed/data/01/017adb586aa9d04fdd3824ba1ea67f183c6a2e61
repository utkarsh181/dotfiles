<p>A the (potentially last) one of my streams before leaving my stable internet connection, I'll be doing a stream with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrrEuHiQjN2CUo84g5tk7w">tripcode!Q/7</a>.</p>

<p>We will be leafing through a folder of technology memes are reviewing and responding to them.</p>

<p>Don't even ask, I'm not uploading them!</p>
