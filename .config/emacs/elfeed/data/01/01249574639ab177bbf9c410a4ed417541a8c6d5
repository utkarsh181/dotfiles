<p>A couple days ago, I went by Elberton, Georgia, home of the notorious Georgia Guidestones.
Just for fun, I filmed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHHRibortwE">a brief video there</a>.
Check it out!
</p>

<p>The Guidestones are a mysterious monument built only a couple of decades ago by unknown persons with inscriptions in several modern and ancient languages, also including astrological guides.
They've often been attributed to the Rosicrucians, Luciferians or some other clandestine groups and have popped up in numerous conspiracy documentaries and commentaries.
</p>

<p>As I mention in the video, I have a somewhat indirect connection to the monument, as a former professor of mine at the University of Georgia was hired to give the Greek and Sanskrit translations.
I believe other UGA professors provided the other translations as well, but they were all commissioned by a unknown "Mr. Christian" to do so and no one really knows what's behind these stones.
