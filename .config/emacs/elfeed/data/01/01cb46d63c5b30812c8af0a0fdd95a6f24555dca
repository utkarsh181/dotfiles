<p>I put my new blog system on Github. Again, just a little 70-ish line script that generates HTML and RSS/XML code automatically from a post; it'll get me a lot for very little, and obviously doesn't involve any silly databases.</p>

<p>Check out the link at <a href="https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb">https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb</a>. Play around with it if you're interested in it for your own purposes. I might do a video on it in a bit, and I'll be refining it as needed.</p>
