<p>I'm thinking about getting a document camera for recording videos in the future that require writing on paper.
I'd like it to have a USB interface that I can connect to my computer an screencast directly as if it were another webcam.

I honestly don't know what's out there, so if anyone is familiar with anything recommendable and not too expensive (I don't want to spend more than a hundred dollars or so), feel free to tell me your experience with any particular model.
