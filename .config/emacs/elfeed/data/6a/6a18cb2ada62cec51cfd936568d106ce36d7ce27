<p>Welp I've spent about a week moving my websites to a VPS (several attempts at different services actually). I've only just now finally had some success. I originally was going to try Digital Ocean, but they don't offer good email service. I tried setting up an email server myself, but the amount of work and number of details needed to get everything to work is an order of magnitude more than just running a web server.</p>

<p>So I'm actually using a Namecheap VPS now, which is the registrar of my domains anyway. I thought this would make transferring my hosting easy (It wasn't). Namecheap has atrocious documentation and their site is extremely slow and non-responsive (thankfully their hosting servers/VPSs aren't). Regardless, I've gotten my website working (with https) and my email with their email service after several days of making DNS changes blindly and checking the results on update 24 hours later.</p>

<p>On a side note, SSL is one of the more difficult things to configure manually. While there are tools like Let's Encrypt, they can often be a pain to get working with different hosts and especially when you're like me and want wildcard certificates for your multiple sites. I really do not understand why hosts don't automate this process for most use cases (actually I do, because most of them get money off of selling partial automation).</p>

<p>Anyway, the looming issue is the forum. Host Gator automatically installed the (outdated) myBB backend for the forum, so I've never done the process myself manually. I'm going to have to figure that out soon enough, which will require me to get some mySQL database up and running (again, I've never done this before).</p>
