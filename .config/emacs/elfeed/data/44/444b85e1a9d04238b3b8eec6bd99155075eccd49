<p>nnn is quite speedy and has a design that will be somewhat unfamiliar to some, using only environmental variables for configuration, instead of either traditional dotfiles or suckless-like <code>config.h</code> with the intent of recompilation.
Nonetheless, nnn has all the basics you need, lacking the bloat of ranger.
I'll still be using ranger, as I've fallen into some of its more specific features, but nnn will probably be the best for some of you out there.

<p>Source code is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jarun/nnn">here</a>, although it should be in the Arch default repos.</p>

<p>Also, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Vu7WPkoJo">my video on ranger</a>. I still always get the most questions about what ranger is, so here's the link again ;-)</p>
