<p>I just released a video talking about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWGptIBApQo">why I don't do Linux "evangelism"</a>.
This is part of the ever growing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-p5XmQHB_JRlxgcaj-WxkAylXFuE0gyk">"Boomer Rants in Woods"</a> series.
</p>

<p>
I detail why in the video, but it ammounts to two main points:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>People are egotistically attached to what operating system they use and treat you trying to convince them what to use as a personal insult. Trying to convince people usually ammounts to making them less open to change.</li>
	<li>Even when you can convince people that using Linux is "good" in an abstract sense, <em>they don't know how to</em> and usually end up trying to replicate their behavior on Windows/Mac OSX and become disappointed that they can't perfectly do so. I use my example of foobar2000 in the video.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The "solution" to these constraints is simple: if you want to get people to be more open to Linux, <em>show them what you can actually do on it</em>.
This solves both problems.
</p>

<p>While I certainly don't have my channel for Linux evangelism, I do feel like the channel has approached doing just that as time has gone on.
I don't talk conceptually about Linux or *nix generally unless it's after showcasing some feature or explaining the efficiency of a design.
This encourages people to actually understand Linux, how it's different from their common experience and encourages them that they might benefit from using it.
