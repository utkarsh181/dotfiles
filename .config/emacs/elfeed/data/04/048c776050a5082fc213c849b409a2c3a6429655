<p>I've put up two more videos in the past two days:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMSByvFHOro">Terminal vs. Bash vs. Command line vs. Prompt</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NJIj47Tusw">"Keep Politics out of Technology!" t. Boomer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, I've been unable to fix LARBS installs in the past several days for general business reasons and I need to test some things with respect to fonts.
The main emoji font used by LARBS, ttf-symbola, has had its license changed and that is an upstream problem I need to find an alternative for.
This is especially a problem because if unicode characters aren't rendering correctly, st especially has a tendency to crash when rendering them.
If you install LARBS, run into this kind of problem and want to fix it, you'll have to find an alternative font yourself until I get the chance to find a permanent solution.</p>
