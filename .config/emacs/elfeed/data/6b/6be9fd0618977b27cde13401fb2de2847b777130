<p>I've set up the livestream <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgKQSLmvyB0">link here</a>.
It should go live in around 6 hours: 6:30 EST.
You might be able to use the chatroom in the meantime; I'm not sure myself, but you can try it out.

As I mentioned, I'll be playing some short, mostly inane meme videos during the stream on occasions.
If you have any you'd like to recommend, send them to me now! Any topic, so long as they're <em>short</em> (3 minutes is really pushing it) and <em>actually entertaining</em>.

<p>Send them via email without delay: <a target="_blank" href="mailto:luke@lukesmith.xyz">luke@lukesmith.xyz</a></p>
