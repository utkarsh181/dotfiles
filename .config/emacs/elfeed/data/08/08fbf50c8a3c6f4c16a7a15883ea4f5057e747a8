<p>We had an actually somewhat long <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhmP8j3qAmk">livestream</a> last night, as I had nothing much to do in my hotel room.
Thanks to all the Super Chatters (I totally forgot I had super chats now, so I should do streams more often to git some money...). Here are the top d'nators:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>$29 Opinion discarded</li>
	<li>$10 Apocalypse Lemon</li>
	<li>$10 Robert Smith</li>
	<li>$10 Nate Edwards</li>
	<li>$5 Dominick Allen</li>
	<li>$4 Yawning Gull</li>
	<li>£2 Dink Dinkleberg</li>
	<li>€1 Daniel Gómez Bellido</li>
	<li>$2 YouTube</li>
	<li>$2 LibertarianBot</li>
</ul>

<p>Come to think about it, I might start actually doing topical serious streams on things related to the podcast, or respond to feedback in them. We'll see about this.</p>
