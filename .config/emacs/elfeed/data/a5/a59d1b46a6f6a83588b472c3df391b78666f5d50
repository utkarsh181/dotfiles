<p>An Arch update to <code>ttf-inconsolata</code> has temporarily broken the font.
If you're a member of an Arch forum or IRC, I recommend notifying them/the developer of this.
I don't have an account there.</p>

<p>
Since Inconsolata is the default monospace in LARBS, I've been getting a lot of emails as to how to fix or patch this.
Just change your default monospace font in <code>~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> to another install monospace font.
If you don't know what monospace fonts you have installed, list them with <code>fc-list | grep -i mono</code>.
See our Github issue.
