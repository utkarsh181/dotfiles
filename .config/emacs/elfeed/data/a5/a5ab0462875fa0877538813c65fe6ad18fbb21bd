<p>I'm going to be writing some slightly more pictorial articles on my website with memes and such. I have a couple in the works and you can see the first here: <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/nitpick.html">Only Mediocre Minds Nitpick.</a></p>

<p>Yeah it's separate from my blog system. I'm going to mull over how to best do it all.</p>

<p>Either way, the message of that article is highly important! More to come!</p>
