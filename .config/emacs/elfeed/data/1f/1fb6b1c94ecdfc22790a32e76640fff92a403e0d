<p>You may have heard already, but it appears that Terry Davis is confirmed to have died last month in what seems to have been a suicide. I just put up a brief video on this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs_fEkU8Qco">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can still go to his site at <a target="_blank" href="http://templeos.org">TempleOS.org</a> which has the downloads to Temple OS and a brief update after his death.</p>
