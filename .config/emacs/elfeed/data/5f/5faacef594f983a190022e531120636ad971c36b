Hi there! It appears you're new to 4chan.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you heard about it on Reddit or one of the other Content Aggregation sites you frequent.
Since you're new, let me let you in on a little secret...
You see, 4chan doesn't work like other sites.
You don't get upvotes for sharing content and no 4chan user cares about e-celebs.
</p>

<p>
You see, maybe you really like the videos I put out on YouTube.
Maybe they've really changed your life even.
That's great!
Unfortunately, it is not polite to share my videos on 4chan!
Not polite to me, nor to 4chan users!
</p>

<p>
You see, on 4chan, anonymity is paramount and e-celebrities are frowned upon.
Linking to my content unsolicited looks like an extremely cringey advertisement!
If someone specifically asks for something that I have covered, this would be an appropriate time to link to one of my videos on 4chan, albeit without fanfare or specific personal glorification of me.
However, uninvited links to my content, especially saying "Wow look what Luke Smith did" when no one asks is the highest form of faux pas.
</p>

<p>
Since 4chan is an anonymous message board, you also make me look bad because people might think I, in sheer desperation for views, am the one linking by videos for consumption on the board.
I am very ashamed when I see my personality brought up my a cringey fan on 4chan.
As I've become more popular, this evokes stronger and stronger feelings of jealousy among 4chan users.
Thus sharing my content is not appropriate behavior there, although on other sites it might be fine!
</p>

<p>
Remember that everyone who matters on /g/ already watches my channel.
Those who don't know about it could easily find my tutorials and other content on any topic by searching for them if needed.
On 4chan, respecting other users' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory#Positive_and_negative_face">Negative Face</a> is a high priority unless you are simply shitposting, so please do not be overbearing, especially with respect to people with public internet presences like myself.
</p>
<p>
Or as they user to say in the old days: lurk moar.
Or at least go back to Reddit where you belong!
