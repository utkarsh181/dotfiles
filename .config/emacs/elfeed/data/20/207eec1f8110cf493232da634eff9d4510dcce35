<p>I've put up a video entitled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eoN7EqZWW4">"In Defense of Pseudoscience"</a>, a new episode of "Lunchtime with Luke".
</p>

<p>
A couple months ago, I wrote a brief blogpost to this effect, but in general, I've always rejected the entire invented problem of "the demarkation problem" which was the fuss of a lot of philosophers in the early 20th century.
It was an attempt to formally specify what constitutes true "science" versus non-science or "pseudoscience".
</p>

<p>I explain precisely why in the video, and provide some example of how "pseudoscience" is often the only real drive of scientific development.</p>
