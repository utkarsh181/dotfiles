<p>I neglected to mention on the RSS feed yesterday, but I put up <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JP0Jx41v7M">a new video</a> just talking about some channel progress and workflow.</p>

<p>I've actually already recording one of the videos for the "make your own website" series and I may have another done soon. Expect them some time next week.</p>

<p>I've also started putting together a review of my new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pckeyboard.com/page/category/EnduraPro">Unicomp Endurapro keyboard</a>. There are actually a lot of things I want to put into it to give people a full view of it. I might finish this video either today or tomorrow.</p>
