<p>I've been contemplating doing a series on creating and maintaining your own website.
The motivation is simple: too few people have their own platforms on the internet and are increasingly at the technical and frankly emotional mercy of social media sites, begging not to be "deplatformed".
I talk about this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYDwep9yI8A">in a new video</a>.
</p>

I'm already starting to think through how I want the series to look, it might only be two somewhat long videos, but I'll probably show people the kind of setup that I have with a VPS.
Suggestions are welcome, so long as they are... reasonable.
Also, in the process of making this video, I will probably be using real life hosts/registrars:
<b>If anyone has anything bad or good to say about a registrar or host service, feel free to tell me</b>.
I say this because if I use or bring up Namecheap (my VPS host) as an example in the video, that will probably bring new users/customers to them.
I don't want to positively or even neutrally mention any host/registrar that has a bad record (for example, GoDaddy is a terrible host and I'll probably specifically note it).
